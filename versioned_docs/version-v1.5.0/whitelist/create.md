# Whitelists in parsing

When a whitelist is present in parsing `/etc/crowdsec/parsers/...`, it will be checked/discarded before being poured to any bucket. These whitelists intentionally generate no logs and are useful to discard noisy false positive sources.

## Whitelist by IP address

Let's assume we have a setup with a `crowdsecurity/nginx` collection enabled and no whitelists.

Thus, if I "attack" myself :

```bash
nikto -host myfqdn.com
```

my own IP address will be flagged as being an attacker :

```bash
$ tail -f /var/log/crowdsec.log 
ime="07-07-2020 16:13:16" level=warning msg="80.x.x.x triggered a 4h0m0s ip ban remediation for [crowdsecurity/http-bad-user-agent]" bucket_id=cool-smoke event_time="2020-07-07 16:13:16.579581642 +0200 CEST m=+358819.413561109" scenario=crowdsecurity/http-bad-user-agent source_ip=80.x.x.x

^C
sudo cscli decisions list
4 local decisions:
+--------+---------------+-----------------------------------+------+--------+---------+---------------------------+--------+------------+
| SOURCE |      IP       |              REASON               | BANS | ACTION | COUNTRY |            AS             | EVENTS | EXPIRATION |
+--------+---------------+-----------------------------------+------+--------+---------+---------------------------+--------+------------+
| local  | 80.x.x.x   | crowdsecurity/http-bad-user-agent |    4 | ban    | FR      | 21502 SFR SA              |     60 | 3h59m3s    |
...

```


### Create the whitelist by IP address

Let's create a `/etc/crowdsec/parsers/s02-enrich/mywhitelists.yaml` file with the following content :

```yaml
name: crowdsecurity/whitelists
description: "Whitelist events from my ip addresses"
whitelist:
  reason: "my ip ranges"
  ip:
    - "80.x.x.x"
```

```bash title="Reload CrowdSec"
sudo systemctl reload crowdsec
```

### Test the whitelist

Thus, if we restart our attack :

```bash
nikto -host myfqdn.com
```

And we don't get bans :

```bash
$ tail -f /var/log/crowdsec.log  
...
^C
sudo cscli decisions list
No local decisions.
And 21 records from API, 15 distinct AS, 12 distinct countries

```

Here, we don't get *any* logs, as the event have been discarded at parsing time.


## Create whitelist by expression

Now, let's make something more tricky : let's whitelist a **specific** user-agent (of course, it's just an example, don't do this at home !). The [hub's taxonomy](https://hub.crowdsec.net/fields) will helps us to find which data is present in which field.

Let's change our whitelist to :

```yaml
name: crowdsecurity/whitelists
description: "Whitelist events from private ipv4 addresses"
whitelist:
  reason: "private ipv4 ranges"
  expression:
   - evt.Parsed.http_user_agent == 'MySecretUserAgent'
```

Again, let's restart CrowdSec !

For the record, I edited nikto's configuration to use 'MySecretUserAgent' as user-agent, and thus :

```bash
nikto -host myfqdn.com
```

```bash
$ tail -f /var/log/crowdsec.log  
...
time="07-05-2020 09:39:09" level=info msg="Event is whitelisted by Expr !" filter= name=solitary-leaf stage=s02-enrich
...
```


## Whitelist in PostOverflows 


Whitelists in PostOverflows are applied *after* the bucket overflow happens.


:::warning

In PostOverflows, the `evt.Parsed` object will be empty at this stage.

It means that you must work with the [`evt.Overflow`](/expr/event.md#overflow-relevant-fields) object for your expression.

:::

It has the advantage of being triggered only once we are about to take decision about an IP or Range, and thus happens a lot less often.

A good example is the [crowdsecurity/whitelist-good-actors](https://hub.crowdsec.net/author/crowdsecurity/collections/whitelist-good-actors) collection.

But let's craft ours based on our previous example !
First of all, install the [crowdsecurity/rdns postoverflow](https://hub.crowdsec.net/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/rdns) : it will be in charge of enriching overflows with reverse dns information of the offending IP address.

Let's put the following file in `/etc/crowdsec/postoverflows/s01-whitelist/mywhitelists.yaml` :

```yaml
name: me/my_cool_whitelist
description: lets whitelist our own reverse dns
whitelist:
  reason: dont ban my ISP
  expression:
  #this is the reverse of my ip, you can get it by performing a "host" command on your public IP for example
    - evt.Enriched.reverse_dns endsWith '.asnieres.rev.numericable.fr.'
```

After reloading CrowdSec, and launching (again!) nikto :

```bash
nikto -host myfqdn.com
```


```bash
$ tail -f /var/log/crowdsec.log
ime="07-07-2020 17:11:09" level=info msg="Ban for 80.x.x.x whitelisted, reason [dont ban my ISP]" id=cold-sunset name=me/my_cool_whitelist stage=s01
time="07-07-2020 17:11:09" level=info msg="node warning : no remediation" bucket_id=blue-cloud event_time="2020-07-07 17:11:09.175068053 +0200 CEST m=+2308.040825320" scenario=crowdsecurity/http-probing source_ip=80.x.x.x
time="07-07-2020 17:11:09" level=info msg="Processing Overflow with no decisions 80.x.x.x performed 'crowdsecurity/http-probing' (11 events over 313.983994ms) at 2020-07-07 17:11:09.175068053 +0200 CEST m=+2308.040825320" bucket_id=blue-cloud event_time="2020-07-07 17:11:09.175068053 +0200 CEST m=+2308.040825320" scenario=crowdsecurity/http-probing source_ip=80.x.x.x
...

```

This time, we can see that logs are being produced when the event is discarded.

### Create the whitelist with fully qualified domaine name

You might want to whitelist a fully qualified domain name (FQDN eg foo.com), in that case you need to follow this below

Let's put the following file in `/etc/crowdsec/postoverflows/s01-whitelist/FQDN-whitelists.yaml` (create the folders if not exist):
```yaml
name: me/FQDN-whitlists
description: "Whitelist postoverflows from FQDN"
whitelist:
  reason: "do whitelistings by FQDN"
  expression:
    - evt.Overflow.Alert.Source.IP in LookupHost("foo.com")
    - evt.Overflow.Alert.Source.IP in LookupHost("foo.foo.org")
    - evt.Overflow.Alert.Source.IP in LookupHost("12123564.org")
```
Save and reload CrowdSec before to test

## Whitelists from CAPI (Central API) community blocklist or third party blocklist

From version 1.5.0 a user can specify a list of IP's or IP ranges to be whitelisted from a community blocklist or third party blocklist. You will have to specify a path to the file within `config.yaml` as by default there is no file specified.

```yaml
api:
  server:
    capi_whitelists_path: <path_to_capi_whitelists_file>
```

We recommend to use a file like `/etc/crowdsec/capi_whitelists.yaml` and the contents should be in the following format:

```yaml
ips:
 - 1.2.3.4
 - 2.3.4.5
cidrs:
 - 1.2.3.0/24
```
