## CrowdSec AppSec rules

Rules are the core of the **AppSec Component**. They are used to detect and block attacks.

There are 2 types of rules:

- **In-band rules** are evaluated synchronously and will block the processing of the request until they are evaluated thus allowing a real-time remediation
- **Out-band rules** Out-band rules are dealt with asynchronously and will not delay the processing of the request. They won't allow remediation _at first sight_ but are very useful for handling expensive evaluations or as part of a more complex detection logic (eg, blocking an exploit that spans multiple requests).

**In-band rules** and **out-band rules** differ slightly in their **default** behavior when a rule matches:

- When an **in-band rule** matches:
  - an **alert** is created inside CrowdSec: allowing immediate and long-term remediation against the offending IP.
  - Note: No **event** will be generated by default.
- When an **out-band rule** matches
  - An **event** will be generated and sent through the normal **parsers/scenarios pipeline**, allowing the detection of more complex behaviors.
  - Note: no **alert** will be generated from this out-band rule only, the **parsers/scenarios pipeline** is responsible for raising **alerts** from processed **events**

## Rules File Format

The rule files share some common directives with the scenarios:

- a `name` and `description`
- a `rules` section describing the rule to match the HTTP request
- [a label section](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/next/scenarios/format/#labels)

```yaml
name: crowdsecurity/example-rule
description: "Detect example pattern"
rules:
  - zones:
      - URI
    transform:
      - lowercase
    match:
      type: contains
      value: this-is-a-appsec-rule-test
labels:
  type: exploit
  service: http
  behavior: "http:exploit"
  confidence: 3
  spoofable: 0
  label: "A good description of the rule"
  classification:
    - cve.CVE-xxxx-xxxxx
    - attack.Txxxx
```

The `rules` contain one or more conditions that can be linked together by an operator (`or`/`and`).
Each condition contains:

## Target

:::info
The target allows to specify which part of the requests needs to be inspected. You can have more than one.
:::

- _(mandatory)_ `zones` one or more of:
  - `ARGS`: Query string parameters
  - `ARGS_NAMES`: Name of the query string parameters
  - `BODY_ARGS`: Body args
  - `BODY_ARGS_NAMES`: Name of the body args
  - `HEADERS`: HTTP headers sent in the request
  - `HEADERS_NAMES`: Name of the HTTP headers sent in the request
  - `METHOD`: HTTP method of the request
  - `PROTOCOL`: HTTP protocol used in the query (HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, ...)
  - `URI`: The URI of the request
  - `RAW_BODY`: The entire body of the request
  - `FILENAMES`: The name of the files sent in the request
- _(optional)_ `variables` containing one or more variable names to restrict the matching operation to (only relevant for `ARGS`, `BODY_ARGS` and `HEADERS`)

```yaml
#match only in 'foo' and 'bar' query string parameters
- zones:
    - ARGS
  variables:
    - foo
    - bar
---
#match in any args or part of the URI
- zones:
    - URI
    - ARGS
```

## Match

:::info
Match provides the pattern to match the target against, including optional transformations.
:::

- _(mandatory)_ `match` containing both:

  - _(mandatory)_ `type` indicates the matching method, one of:

    - `regex`: matches _target_ against value (_value_ is a RE2 regexp)
    - `equals`: _target_ is a string equal to _value_
    - `startsWith`: _target_ starts with _value_
    - `endsWith`: _target_ ends with _value_
    - `contains`: _target_ contains value
    - `libinjectionSQL`: _target_ is detected by lib injection SQL
    - `libinjectionXSS`: _target_ is detected by lib injection XSS
    - `gt`: _target_ is greater than _value_
    - `lt`: _target_ is lower than _value_
    - `gte`: _target_ is greater or equal to _value_
    - `lte`: _target_ is lower or equal to _value_

  - _(mandatory)_ `value` a string that is compared to the _target_

- _(optional)_ `transform` section, containing one or more operations that will be applied on _target_ before performing the match operation:
  - `lowercase`
  - `uppercase`
  - `b64decode` : base64 decode
  - `hexdecode` : hex decode
  - `length` : transform _target_ to a number representing the string's length

```yaml
# we want the query parameter foo to be equal to 'toto'
- zones:
    - ARGS
  variables:
    - foo
  match:
    type: equal
    value: toto
---
# we want URI to contain any variation of 'blah' (ie. blah BLah BlAH ...)
- zones:
    - URI
  tranform:
    - uppercase
  match:
    type: contains
    value: BLAH
```

### Seclang Support

In order to support your existing/legacy rules set, CrowdSec's AppSec Component is also able to load rules in the **seclang** format (**ModSecurity** rules).

We recommend using this format only to use existing rules you may have.

**ModSecurity** syntax support is provided by [coraza](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/), and the reference documentation is available [here](https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/syntax/).

There are 2 ways to provide crowdsec with seclang rules:

- Provide rules directly by using the `seclang_rules` parameter in your rule file
- Provide a file containing the rules by using the `seclang_rules_file` parameter in your rule file. The file must be located inside CrowdSec data directory

:::info
The default paths for the data directory per OS:

- Linux: `/var/lib/crowdsec/data`
- Freebsd: `/var/db/crowdsec/data`
- Windows: `C:\programdata\crowdsec\data`
  :::

```yaml
name: example/secrules
seclang_rules:
  - SecRule ARGS:ip ";" "t:none,log,deny,msg:'semi colon test',id:2"
seclang_files_rules:
  - my-rule-file.conf
```
