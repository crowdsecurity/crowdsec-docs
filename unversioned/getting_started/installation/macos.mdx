# MacOS Deployment

:::warning
We do not compile software directly for MacOS. You can use a container runtime like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run a Linux container on MacOS.
:::

:::tip
We advise you to use our online sandbox to test CrowdSec on MacOS since it comes with a preinstalled application.

[Find it here](https://killercoda.com/iiamloz/scenario/crowdsec-setup)
:::

Before getting started it is advised to read the [prerequisites](/unversioned/getting_started/prerequisites.md) page to understand the requirements for running CrowdSec.

## Running CrowdSec on MacOS

Open a terminal and ensure the docker runtime is currently running on your MacOS machine.

```bash
docker version
```

```bash title="Command Output"
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           20.10.7
 API version:       1.41
 Go version:        go1.13.15
 Git commit:        f0df350
 Built:             Wed Jun  2 11:56:35 2021
 OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64
 Context:           default
 Experimental:      true

  Version:          1.0.0-rc95
  GitCommit:        b9ee9c6314599f1b4a7f497e1f1f856fe433d3b7
 docker-init:
  Version:          0.19.0
  GitCommit:        de40ad0
```

Once you have confirmed that the docker runtime is running, you can pull the CrowdSec docker image and run it.

```bash
docker pull crowdsecurity/crowdsec
```

```bash title="Command Output"
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from crowdsecurity/crowdsec
Digest: sha256:
Status: Image is up to date for crowdsecurity/crowdsec:latest
docker.io/crowdsecurity/crowdsec:latest
```

Now you can run the CrowdSec container.

```bash
docker run -d --name crowdsec -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /etc/crowdsec:/etc/crowdsec -v /var/log:/var/log crowdsecurity/crowdsec
```

:::warning
Since we are running on MacOS there might not be any applications running locally for us to detect, it is advised to use the [online sandbox](https://killercoda.com/iiamloz/scenario/crowdsec-setup) to test CrowdSec.
:::

You can bring down the container down by running the following Command

```bash
docker rm --force crowdsec
```
