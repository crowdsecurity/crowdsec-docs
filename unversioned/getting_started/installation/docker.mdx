# Docker / Podman Deployment

:::info
Prerequisites are written for bare metal installations. Please keep in mind the containerization layer may make some of these items unnecessary.
:::

Before getting started it is advised to read the [prerequisites](/unversioned/getting_started/prerequisites.md) page to understand the requirements for running CrowdSec.

## Docker

We will presume you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Run

Docker run command will run a container, this is useful for testing and development purposes.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name crowdsec \
  --volume /etc/crowdsec:/etc/crowdsec \
  --volume /var/lib/crowdsec/data/:/var/lib/crowdsec/data/ \
  --volume /var/log:/var/log:ro \
  crowdsecurity/crowdsec:latest
```

However, for most users it is recommended to use `compose` module for production deployments. Since it allows you to define your container deployments in a more structured format.

### Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container setups in a structured format. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.

Here is a snippet:

```yaml
crowdsec:
  image: crowdsecurity/crowdsec
  restart: always
  environment:
    COLLECTIONS: "crowdsecurity/nginx"
    GID: "${GID-1000}"
  depends_on:
    - 'reverse-proxy'
  volumes:
    - ./crowdsec/acquis.yaml:/etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml
    - logs:/var/log/nginx
    - crowdsec-db:/var/lib/crowdsec/data/
    - crowdsec-config:/etc/crowdsec/
```

:::info
`Compose` snippet was taken from our [example-docker-compose repository](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/example-docker-compose/blob/57d55e5cd4d08ef5843bd1a32becde3c35e45507/basic/docker-compose.yml#L33-L47) which contains many examples of how CrowdSec container can be used in different setups. 
:::

#### Compose key aspects

If you dont find an example that fits your needs, you can create your own `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are the key aspects:

##### Provide Access To Logs

Since CrowdSec is running within a container layer you need to provide access to log sources within the example above we provide a named volume called `logs` which other containers will output their log files too.

```yaml
volumes:
  - logs:/var/log/nginx
```

##### Persistent Data Directories

We recommend persisting the following directories:

```yaml
volumes:
  - crowdsec-db:/var/lib/crowdsec/data/ ## Data Directory
  - crowdsec-config:/etc/crowdsec/ ## Configuration Directory
```

:::info
If you haven't used named volumes within Docker before you can read their [documentation here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#use-a-volume-with-docker-compose)
:::

##### Depends On

Depends on directive allows Docker to bring up the compose stack in "order", the reason we use it within the snippet the container `reverse-proxy` creates the log files on startup and we want to make sure CrowdSec finds these files to monitor. 

```yaml
depends_on:
  - 'reverse-proxy'
```


## Next Steps?

Great, you now have CrowdSec installed on your system. Within the [post installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.md) you will find the next steps to configure and optimize your installation.
