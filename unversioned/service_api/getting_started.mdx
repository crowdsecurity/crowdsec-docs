## What is the Service API ?

The **Service API**, **SAPI** for short, provides access to selected **CrowdSec SaaS features**.
New SaaS features will usually appear on **SAPI** first before getting their UI counterpart.
The current capabilities of this API are:

-  **Blocklist** creation & management
   -  Allowing you to create private blocklists and share them 
   -  As well as subscribing to any of the blocklists available to your organization
-  **Integrations** endpoints creation & management
   -  An Essential part of the **Blocklist as a Service** feature.
   -  Manage endpoints for your [**Firewalls**](/u/integrations/intro) or [**Remediation Components**](/u/bouncers/intro) to connect directly to.

## Getting your API keys

The CrowdSec Service API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can create an API key in the CrowdSec Console by:

1. **Logging in** to the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/) and go to the **Settings** page.
