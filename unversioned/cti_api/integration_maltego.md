Maltego transforms, which allow users to enrich IP entities in maltego with CrowdSec CTI intelligence.In this documentation we'll answer the following questions:

- How to create your private TDS (pTDS)
- Where to install and configure the crowdsec transforms
- What our 11 transforms do

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

Make sure your instance has docker and docker compose installed. The instance should have a public IP.

### Steps

#### Starting the transform server

Clone the repo and cd into it and start docker compose:

```
git clone https://github.com/crowdsecurity/maltego-transforms
cd maltego-transforms
docker compose up
```

#### Modify settings to point to your IP

With your current working directory being in the cloned repo. Run the following command to point the settings to your instance's IP

```
sed -i "s/my_ip/1.2.3.4/g" transforms.csv
```

Replace **1.2.3.4** with your instance's IP


#### Registering at pTDS

##### Importing Transforms

1. Navigate your browser to [pTDS website](https://public-tds.paterva.com/ptds/login)

2. Create an account and login.

3. Navigate to [Transforms](https://public-tds.paterva.com/transforms)

4. Click on import Transforms.

5. Click on Choose File and navigate to `transforms.csv` file we modified earlier.

6. Finally click on **Import Transform** Button

##### Creating a Seed

1. Navigate to [Seeds](https://public-tds.paterva.com/seeds)

2. Click on **Add Seed** Button.

3. Fill in the Seed Name, with name of your choice.

4. Click on the Transforms dropdown  and select all the CrowdSec Transforms.

5. Click on the **Add Seed** Button.


Done ! You can now share the Seed URL to maltego clients, and they'd be able to use the transforms. 


## User Guide

### Installation

#### Registering the Seed URL

In your maltego client register the Seed URL we created in the above deployment guide  by following [this guide](https://docs.maltego.com/support/solutions/articles/15000011965-how-do-i-add-a-new-transform-seed-to-my-maltego-client-)

#### Adding CrowdSec API key to the transforms

1. Obtain the CrowdSec CTI API key by following [this guide.](/cti_api/getting_started.mdx)

2. Follow [this guide](https://docs.maltego.com/support/solutions/articles/15000017851-setting-api-keys-for-all-transforms-inside-a-hub-item) except select CrowdSec Transform Server.

3. Copy paste the API key in the `API key` field in the tranform properties

Done !

### Usage

All the CrowdSec transforms take the **builtin IP entity** as an input. You'd have an option to run them whenever you right click an IP entity. A caching system allows you to run multiple transforms on the same IP without consuming your quotas for each transform. The cache expiration can be found in the transform settings. 

As per your requirements you can either run multiple transforms or just a single one.

Below is a reference to what each transform does.
