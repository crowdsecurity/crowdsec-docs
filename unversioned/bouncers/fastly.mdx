# cs-fastly-bouncer

A Remediation Component that syncs the decisions made by CrowdSec with Fastly's VCL. Manages multi account, multi service setup. Supports IP, Country and AS scoped decisions.
To learn how to setup crowdsec to consume fastly logs see [this](/docs/next/user_guides/consuming_fastly_logs)


# Installation:

## Using pip

Make sure you have python3.8+ installed. Now in a virtual environment run the following:

```bash
pip install crowdsec-fastly-bouncer
crowdsec-fastly-bouncer -g <FASTLY_TOKEN_1>,<FASTLY_TOKEN_2> > config.yaml # generate config
vim config.yaml # Set crowdsec LAPI key, url, recaptcha keys, logging etc
crowdsec-fastly-bouncer -c config.yaml # Run it !
```

See how to obtain fastly account tokens [here](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens). The tokens must have write access for the configured services.

**Note:** If your bouncer is not installed on the same machine than LAPI, don't forget to set the `lapi_url` and `lapi_key` in the configuration file /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-fastly-bouncer.yaml

**Note:** For captcha to work you must provide the `recaptcha_site_key` and `recaptcha_secret_key` for each service. Learn how [here](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)


## Using Docker 

Make sure you have docker or podman installed. In this guide we will use docker, but podman would work as a drop in replacement too.

### Initial Setup

```bash
docker run crowdsecurity/fastly-bouncer \
 -g <FASTLY_TOKEN_1>,<FASTLY_TOKEN_2> > cfg.yaml # auto-generate fastly config for provided comma separated tokens 
vi cfg.yaml # review config and set `crowdsec_lapi_key`
touch fastly-cache.json
```

The `lapi_key` can be obtained by running the following:
```bash
sudo cscli -oraw bouncers add fastlybouncer # -oraw flag can discarded for human friendly output.
```

The `lapi_url` must be accessible from the container.

### Run the component

```bash
  docker run \
  -v $PWD/cfg.yaml:/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-fastly-bouncer.yaml \
  -v $PWD/fastly-cache.json:/var/lib/crowdsec/crowdsec-fastly-bouncer/cache/fastly-cache.json \
  crowdsecurity/fastly-bouncer
```

## Activate the new configuration:

After starting the component, go in the fastly web UI. For each configured service review the version created by the bouncer. If everything looks good, you can activate the new configration !

# Configuration:

```yaml
crowdsec_config: 
  lapi_key: ${LAPI_KEY} 
  lapi_url: "http://localhost:8080/"

fastly_account_configs:
  - account_token: # Obtain this from fastly
    services: 
      - id: # The id of the service
        recaptcha_site_key: # Required for captcha support
        recaptcha_secret_key: # Required for captcha support
        max_items: 20000 # max_items refers to the capacity of IP/IP ranges to ban/captcha. 
        activate: false # # Set to true, to activate the new config in production
        reference_version: # version to clone/use
        clone_reference_version: true # whether to clone the "reference_version".
        captcha_cookie_expiry_duration: '1800'  # Duration to persist the cookie containing proof of solving captcha

bouncer_version:
update_frequency: 10 # Duration in seconds to poll the crowdsec API
log_level: info # Valid choices are either of "debug","info","warning","error"
log_mode: stdout # Valid choices are "file" or "stdout" or "stderr"
log_file: /var/log/crowdsec-fastly-bouncer.log # Ignore if logging to stdout or stderr
```

# Helpers:

The component has few builtin helper features:

## Auto config generator:

**Usage:**

```bash
crowdsec-fastly-bouncer -c <PATH_TO_BASE_CONFIG>\
    -g <FASTLY_TOKEN_1>,<FASTLY_TOKEN_2> 
```

This will print boilerplate config with sane defaults for the provided comma separted fastly tokens.
Always review the generated config before proceeding further.

Crowdsec config is copied from the config at `PATH_TO_BASE_CONFIG`. 

##  Cleaner:

**Usage:**

```bash
sudo crowdsec-fastly-bouncer -c <PATH_TO_BASE_CONFIG> -d
```

This deletes the fastly resources created by the component.
It only works if the configured service version is not locked.
It is useful for quick iteration before activateing the new service.
