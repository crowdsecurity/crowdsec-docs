# Local API

The Local API (LAPI) is a core component of CrowdSec and has a few essential missions :

 - Allow CrowdSec machines to push alerts & decisions to a database
 - Allow bouncers to consume said alerts & decisions from database
 - Allow `cscli` to view add or delete decisions


You can find the swagger documentation [here](https://crowdsecurity.github.io/api_doc/lapi/).

## Authentication

There are two kinds of authentication to the Local API :

 - Bouncers: they authenticate with an API key and can only read decisions

 - Machines: they authenticate with a login and password and can not only read decisions, but create new ones too

  - TLS client certificates: it allows you to connect new bouncers or agents to the local API without registring them first 


### Bouncers

To register a bouncer to your API, you need to run the following command on the server where the API is installed:

```bash
sudo cscli bouncers add testBouncer
```

and keep the generated API token to use it in your bouncers configuration file.

See [here](/docs/next/local_api/tls_auth) for the documentation about TLS authentication.


### Machines

To allow a machine to communicate with the Local API, the machine needs to be validated by an administrator of the Local API.

There are two ways to register a CrowdSec to a Local API.

* You can create a machine directly on the API server that will be automatically validated by running the following command on the server where the API is installed:

```bash
sudo cscli machines add testMachine
```

If your CrowdSec agent runs on the same server as the Local API, then the credentials file (including the API URL) will be generated automatically, otherwise you will have to copy/paste them in `/etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml` on the agent machine.

* You can use `cscli` to register to the API server:

```
sudo cscli lapi register -u <api_url>
```

And validate it with `cscli` on the server where the API is installed:

```
sudo cscli machines validate <machineName>
```

:::tip
You can use `cscli machines list` to list all the machines registered to the API and view the ones that are not validated yet.

See [here](/docs/next/local_api/tls_auth) for the documentation about TLS authentication.


## Configuration

### Client

By default, `crowdsec` and `cscli` use `127.0.0.1:8080` as the default Local API. However you might want to use a remote API and configure a different endpoint for your API client.

#### Register to a remote API server

* On the remote CrowdSec server, run:

```
sudo cscli lapi register -u http://<remote_api>:<port>
```

* On the Local API server, validate the machine by running the command:


```bash
sudo cscli machines list # to get the name of the new registered machine
```

```
sudo cscli machines validate <machineName>
```


### Server

#### Configure listen URL

If you would like your Local API to be used by a remote CrowdSec you will need to modify the URL it listens on.
Modify the [`listen_uri` option](/docs/next/configuration/crowdsec_configuration#listen_uri) in the main configuration file.
Then see [how to configure your crowdsec to use a remote API](/u/user_guides/machines_mgmt#machine-register).


#### Enable SSL

The most common use case of the Local API is to listen on 127.0.0.1. In that case there's no need for
configuring any SSL layer. In some cases, the Local API will listen for other CrowdSec installations that
will report their triggered scenarios. In that case the endpoint may be configured with SSL.
You can see how to configure SSL on your Local API [here](/docs/next/configuration/crowdsec_configuration#tls).
