The CrowdSec Checkpoint integration allows you to block malicious IPs in your Checkpoint firewall. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate CrowdSec blocklists with your Checkpoint firewall.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure your Checkpoint device supports ingesting blocklists. If you are unsure, please refer to the Checkpoint documentation or contact Checkpoint support.

### Steps

We will presume you followed the [Getting Started](integrations/intro.mdx) guide and have created an account on the CrowdSec Console.

Once you are authenticated, you can proceed to the Blocklist tab located on the top menu bar, from there you can select the Integrations sub menu.

Once the page has loaded, you can click the "Connect" button under the Checkpoint logo.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_checkpoint_card_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_checkpoint_card_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Doing so will prompt you to name this integration, you can name it anything you like, for example "My Integration ". Note the name should be unique per integration that is tied to your account.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Once the integration is generated you will be presented with a credentials screen that will provide you with the necessary information to configure your Checkpoint Firewall. This information will **ONLY** be displayed once, so please ensure you copy it down.

        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_checkpoint_credentials_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_checkpoint_credentials_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

## Checkpoint Configuration


In the gateways and servers tab, double-click on the specific gateway you want to configure

![](/img/checkpoint_step1.png)

You will have this properties menu, select "Threat Prevention (Custom)", then activate at least Anti-Bot or Anti-Virus.

![](/img/checkpoint_step2.png)

Now go to the "Security policies" tab, and click on "New IOC Feed"

![](/img/checkpoint_step3.png)

Click on "Custom Policy", then below on "Indicators". Add your feed information and click "Test Feed".

You need to put the username and password provided by the console in the "Feed URL" so it can use basic authentication:

```
https://<username>:<password>@admin.api.crowdsec.net/v1/integrations/<integration_id>/content
```

In this example, we used "Raw IP List Format", but you can use checkpoint format and select the data column "1".

Select the Gateway and click "Test Feed"

Check That the feed is working and save the configuration.

You can also take a look at the [Checkpoint Documentation](https://support.checkpoint.com/results/sk/sk132193) for more information (if you want to do it using CLI).

## Format example

The CrowdSec blocklist will be in checkpoint format, with formatted data per line. Here is an example of how the blocklist will look:

```
Accessobserv2,192.168.38.187,IP,high,high,AB,C&C server IP
Accessobserv2,192.168.38.188,IP,high,high,AB,C&C server IP
```

:::info
The format is as follows: UNIQ-NAME , VALUE , TYPE , CONFIDENCE , SEVERITY , PRODUCT , COMMENT
:::

## Next Steps

Now that you have integrated CrowdSec integration with your Checkpoint Firewall, you can proceed to the [Blocklist Catalog](console/blocklists/catalog.md) to find what blocklists you can subscribe too.
