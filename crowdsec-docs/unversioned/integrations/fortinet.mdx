The CrowdSec Fortinet integration allows you to block malicious IPs in your Fortinet firewall. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate CrowdSec blocklists with your Fortinet firewall.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure your Fortinet device supports ingesting blocklists. If you are unsure, please refer to the Fortinet documentation or contact Fortinet support.

### Steps

We will presume you followed the [Getting Started](integrations/intro.mdx) guide and have created an account on the CrowdSec Console.

Once you are authenticated, you can proceed to the Blocklist tab located on the top menu bar, from there you can select the Integrations sub menu.

Once the page has loaded, you can click the "Connect" button under the Fortinet logo.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_fortinet_card_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_fortinet_card_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Doing so will prompt you to name this integration, you can name it anything you like, for example "My Integration ". Note the name should be unique per integration that is tied to your account.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Once the integration is generated you will be presented with a credentials screen that will provide you with the necessary information to configure your Fortinet Firewall. This information will **ONLY** be displayed once, so please ensure you copy it down.

        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_fortinet_credentials_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_fortinet_credentials_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

## Format example

The CrowdSec blocklist will be in plain text format, with one IP address per line. Here is an example of how the blocklist will look:

```
192.168.38.187
192.168.38.186
```
