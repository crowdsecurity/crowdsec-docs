The CrowdSec Palo Alto integration allows you to block malicious IPs in your Palo Alto firewall. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate CrowdSec blocklists with your Palo Alto firewall.

Palo Alto refers to this feature as [**External Dynamic Lists (EDL)**](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-admin/policy/use-an-external-dynamic-list-in-policy/external-dynamic-list), which allow you to import and automatically update blocklists from external sources.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure your Palo Alto device supports ingesting blocklists. If you are unsure, please refer to the Palo Alto documentation or contact Palo Alto support.

:::warning
Integrations for commnunity plan users are limited to pull once every 24 hours. Pulling more often will result in HTTP 429.
:::

### Steps

We will presume you followed the [Getting Started](integrations/intro.mdx) guide and have created an account on the CrowdSec Console.

Once you are authenticated, you can proceed to the Blocklist tab located on the top menu bar, from there you can select the Integrations sub menu.

Once the page has loaded, you can click the "Connect" button under the Palo Alto logo.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Palo Alto Integration Card"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_paloalto_card_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_paloalto_card_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Doing so will prompt you to name this integration, you can name it anything you like, for example "My Integration ". Note the name should be unique per integration that is tied to your account.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Palo Alto Integration Creation Screen"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Once the integration is generated you will be presented with a credentials screen that will provide you with the necessary information to configure your Palo Alto Firewall. This information will **ONLY** be displayed once, so please ensure you copy it down.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Palo Alto Integration Credentials Screen"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl(
            "/img/console_integrations_paloalto_credentials_light.png"
        ),
        dark: useBaseUrl(
            "/img/console_integrations_paloalto_credentials_dark.png"
        ),
    }}
/>

## Palo Alto Configuration

To configure the paloalto firewall, we will:

1. Create External dynamic list and choose your update frequency.

Go to Objects > External Dynamic Lists > Add

![](/img/paloalto_step1.png)

:::info
You need to put the username and password provided by the console in the "URL" so it can use basic authentication:

```
https://<username>:<password>@admin.api.crowdsec.net/v1/integrations/<integration_id>/content
```

:::

![](/img/paloalto_step2.png)

2. Create a security policy with this dynamic list

Go to Policies > Security > Add

![](/img/paloalto_step3.png)

In General tab, add the general info about the policy.

![](/img/paloalto_step4.png)

In Source tab, select your source zone then the dynamic list created in the source address.

![](/img/paloalto_step5.png)

In Actions tab, select the action ‘Drop‘ and log the action (recommended).

![](/img/paloalto_step6.png)

You should have your policy created, don't forget to click on ‘commit‘.

## Format example

The CrowdSec blocklist will be in plain text format, with one IP address per line. Here is an example of how the blocklist will look:

```
192.168.38.187
192.168.38.186
```

## Manage integration size limits with pagination

If you want to learn how to manage integration size limits with pagination, please refer to the [Managing integrations size limits with pagination](console/service_api/integrations.md#managing-integrations-size-limits-with-pagination) section.

## Contribute to this documentation

Since CrowdSec is a community-driven project, we welcome contributions to this documentation. If you have any instructions or tips that you would like to share with the community, please feel free to open a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec-docs)

## Next Steps

Now that you have integrated CrowdSec integration with your Palo Alto Firewall, you can proceed to the [Blocklist Catalog](console/blocklists/catalog.md) to find what blocklists you can subscribe too.
