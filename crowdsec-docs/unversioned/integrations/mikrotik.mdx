The CrowdSec Mikrotik integration allows you to block malicious IPs in your Mikrotik router. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate CrowdSec blocklists with your Mikrotik router.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure your Mikrotik device supports ingesting blocklists. If you are unsure, please refer to the Mikrotik documentation or contact Mikrotik support.

### Steps

We will presume you followed the [Getting Started](integrations/intro.mdx) guide and have created an account on the CrowdSec Console.

Once you are authenticated, you can proceed to the Blocklist tab located on the top menu bar, from there you can select the Integrations sub menu.

Once the page has loaded, you can click the "Connect" button under the Mikrotik logo.

        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_mikrotik_card_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_mikrotik_card_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Doing so will prompt you to name this integration, you can name it anything you like, for example "My Integration ". Note the name should be unique per integration that is tied to your account.

        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Once the integration is generated you will be presented with a credentials screen that will provide you with the necessary information to configure your Mikrotik Router Firewall. This information will **ONLY** be displayed once, so please ensure you copy it down.

    }}
/>

## Mikrotik Configuration

To configure the Mikrotik router, we will :

1. Create a script that will fetch the blocklist from the CrowdSec API and import it into the Mikrotik firewall.
2. Create a scheduler that will run the script every 10 minutes.

First you need to create a script.

Then you need to add the following script:

```bash
:local name "[crowdsec]"
:local url "https://admin.api.crowdsec.net/v1/integrations/<integration_id>/content"
:local fileName "blocklist.rsc"
:log info "$name fetch blocklist from $url"
/tool fetch url="$url" mode=https dst-path=$fileName http-auth-scheme=basic user="<username>" password="<password>" idle-timeout="30s"
:if ([:len [/file find name=$fileName]] > 0) do={
    :log info "removing old ipv4 blocklist"
     /ip/firewall/address-list/remove [ find where list="crowdsec-integration" ];
    :log info "removing old ipv6 blocklist"
     /ipv6/firewall/address-list/remove [ find where list="crowdsec-integration" ];
    :log info "$name import;start"
    /import file-name=$fileName
    :log info "$name import:done"
} else={
    :log error "$name failed to fetch the blocklist"
}
```

:::info
You need to replace `<integration_id>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with the values provided in the console.
:::

:::warning
Do not change `list="crowdsec-integration"` in the script, as it is used by the data you fetch from the CrowdSec API.
:::

When you click on "OK", the script will be created. You can now run the script and check the logs to see if it is working.

The script is now running and the blocklist is being imported into the Mikrotik firewall. To automate this process, you can create a scheduler that will run the script every 10 minutes.

:::warning
Please be careful with the frequency of the scheduler and the blocklists size your subscribe to your integration, as it may cause performance issues on your Mikrotik device.
:::

## Format example

The CrowdSec blocklist will be in mikrotik format, with formatted data per line. Here is an example of how the blocklist will look:

```

/ip firewall address-list add list=crowdsec-integration address=1.2.3.4 comment="crowdsec/mikrotik" timeout=48h;
/ip6 firewall address-list add list=crowdsec-integration address=2001:0db8:85a3::/128 comment="crowdsec/mikrotik" timeout=48h;
```

Since CrowdSec is a community-driven project, we welcome contributions to this documentation. If you have any instructions or tips that you would like to share with the community, please feel free to open a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec-docs)

## Next Steps

Now that you have integrated CrowdSec integration with your Mikrotik router, you can proceed to the [Blocklist Catalog](console/blocklists/catalog.md) to find what blocklists you can subscribe too.
