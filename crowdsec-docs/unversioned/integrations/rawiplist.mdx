The CrowdSec **Raw IP List** integration allows you to block malicious IPs in your Firewall. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate CrowdSec blocklists with your Firewall.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure your device supports ingesting the raw IP format (one ip per line).

### Steps

We will presume you followed the [Getting Started](integrations/intro.mdx) guide and have created an account on the CrowdSec Console.

Once you are authenticated, you can proceed to the Blocklist tab located on the top menu bar, from there you can select the Integrations sub menu.

Once the page has loaded, you can click the "Connect" button under the **Raw IP List** logo.

    alt="Raw IP List Integration Card"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_card_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_card_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Doing so will prompt you to name this integration, you can name it anything you like, for example "My Integration ". Note the name should be unique per integration that is tied to your account.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Raw IP List Integration Creation Screen"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Once the integration is generated you will be presented with a credentials screen that will provide you with the necessary information to configure your Firewall. This information will **ONLY** be displayed once, so please ensure you copy it down.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Raw IP ListIntegration Credentials Screen"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_credentials_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_credentials_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

The username and password provided follows a *Basic Authentication* mechanism that you can use with any HTTP client such as `curl`

```
curl -u 'username:password' https://admin.api.crowdsec.net/v1/integrations/${content_id}/content
```

In case you lost your credentials you can regenerate them by clicking `Configure -> Regenerate Credentials` button at the top right corner of the integration.

## Format example

The CrowdSec blocklist will be in plain text format, with one IP address per line. Here is an example of how the blocklist will look:

```
192.168.38.187
192.168.38.186
```
