The CrowdSec Generic Vendor integration allows you to block malicious IPs in your Generic Vendor firewall. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate CrowdSec blocklists with your Generic Vendor firewall.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure your Generic Vendor device supports ingesting blocklists. If you are unsure, please refer to the Generic Vendor documentation or contact Generic Vendor support.

### Steps

We will presume you followed the [Getting Started](integrations/intro.mdx) guide and have created an account on the CrowdSec Console.

Once you are authenticated, you can proceed to the Blocklist tab located on the top menu bar, from there you can select the Integrations sub menu.

Once the page has loaded, you can click the "Connect" button under the Generic Vendor logo.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Generic Vendor Integration Card"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_card_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_card_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Doing so will prompt you to name this integration, you can name it anything you like, for example "My Integration ". Note the name should be unique per integration that is tied to your account.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Generic Vendor Integration Creation Screen"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_creation_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Once the integration is generated you will be presented with a credentials screen that will provide you with the necessary information to configure your Generic Vendor Firewall. This information will **ONLY** be displayed once, so please ensure you copy it down.

    alt="Generic Vendor Integration Credentials Screen"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_credentials_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_integrations_generic_credentials_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

## Format example

The CrowdSec blocklist will be in plain text format, with one IP address per line. Here is an example of how the blocklist will look:

```
192.168.38.187
192.168.38.186
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have integrated CrowdSec integration with your Generic Vendor Firewall, you can proceed to the [Blocklist Catalog](console/blocklists/catalog.md) to find what blocklists you can subscribe too.
