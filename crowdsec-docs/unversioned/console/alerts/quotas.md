## Introduction

At CrowdSec, we're committed to providing a range of cybersecurity solutions tailored to meet the needs of diverse users, from individual enthusiasts to large organizations. Our pricing plans, including the Community and Premium options, are designed to scale with your requirements, ensuring you have the tools and capabilities to monitor and respond to threats effectively.

### Community Plan: Starting Point for Cybersecurity Monitoring

Our Community Plan is designed as an entry point for users beginning to explore the vast cybersecurity landscape. With this plan, users are entitled to:

- **500 Alert Quota**: Receive up to 500 alerts, allowing organizations to stay informed about potential threats to your network.
- **7 Days of Retention**: Access alerts for up to a week, giving you ample time to review and act on them.
  This plan is ideal for individual users or small teams looking for essential monitoring tools without the need for extensive historical data retention or a high volume of alerts.

### Why Upgrade to Premium?

Transitioning to our Premium Plan unlocks a suite of advanced features and capabilities designed for users who require more robust cybersecurity monitoring and analysis.

- **Custom Alert Quotas**: The Premium Plan allows custom quotas for alerts, scaling up to several million depending on the needs. This ensures that your monitoring capabilities grow with your network, no matter how extensive it becomes.
- **Extended Retention Periods**: With up to a year of data retention, the Premium Plan enables long-term analysis and pattern recognition. This extended period is crucial for identifying trends, understanding the evolving nature of threats, and fine-tuning the security posture over time.

### The Value of More Quotas and Longer Retention

More quotas and extended retention periods are essential for several reasons:

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: A higher quota allows for broader monitoring, alerting to various potential threats. This is particularly important in complex or dynamic network environments with numerous and varied threats.
- **Long-Term Security Insights**: Longer retention periods enable the analysis of data over time, identifying trends and patterns that may not be apparent in shorter data sets. This insight is invaluable for predicting future threats and strengthening defenses.
- **Adaptability**: As your network grows, so does the volume of potential alerts. A plan that offers custom quotas ensures that your cybersecurity system can adapt to your changing needs, providing consistent and effective monitoring.
- **Strategic Planning**: Access to historical alert data aids in strategic security planning, allowing you to allocate resources more effectively and prepare for potential future threats based on past patterns.

Understanding the limitations of the Community Plan is crucial for setting realistic expectations regarding alert volume and retention. If you frequently approach or exceed these limits, it may be time to consider upgrading to our Premium Plan.
