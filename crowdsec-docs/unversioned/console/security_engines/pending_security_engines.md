description: Accept or decline Security Engines waiting for enrollment
---

## Introduction

For security reasons, Engines are not enrolled without user verification. A table at the top of your Engines list will display all the waiting requests.
However, you can streamline this process using the "Auto-enroll" feature to automatically enroll your Security Engines.

## Usage

To accept of decline Security Engines waiting enrollment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Security Engines** page.
2. Have a Security Engine pending to be enroll

3. Select the Security Engines and apply the decisions you want about the request(s)

- Accepting the enrollment, we automatically place the selected Security Engines on your list.
- Deleting will decline the request and remove the selected request(s) from your table. This won't affect a new enroll on the same Engine.
