This feature ensures you can promptly address the most pressing security concerns without navigating multiple systems or interfaces.

The [**"Troubleshooting"**](/console/security_engines/troubleshooting) feature is also applied to multiple organizations. Allowing us to find issues directly across all selected organizations.

### Good to know

Foreign Security Engines are not updatable as they are not in the current Organization. To update them, you need to switch to the Organization where the engine is located.

Clicking on a foreign Security Engine Name will switch to the correct organization and redirect to the Security Engine details page.
