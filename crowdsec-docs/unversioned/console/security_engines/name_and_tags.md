---

Effective management of Security Engines allows for modifying information, such as the name and tags associated with the Engines.

- The name must be unique and can be changed at any given time.
- Tags facilitate the tracking of Engines. (Example: Using CrowdSec on "AWS" as a "docker")

## Usage

To update a Security Engine's name or tags, the following steps should be followed:

1. Navigate to the **Security Engines** page.
1. Click on the **"Edit name or tags"** item to access the Engine's menu.
