# Am I Under Attack

## Introduction

The feature Am I Under Attack is the pinnacle of what CrowdSec offers in terms of real-time infrastructure monitoring.

Based on alerts shared by Security Engines, CrowdSec will perform an __AI-powered analysis of the alerts__ raised by the organization.

If an unusual surge of signals is detected, that may __indicate that a targeted attack__ is ongoing on the organization.

If the situation occurs, multiple communication channels will be used to reach out owner and administrator members of the organization.
