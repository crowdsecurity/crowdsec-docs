The CrowdSec Console now offers **Enterprise Support** for users on qualifying plans. This feature allows enterprise users to connect directly with our support team via a built-in chat within the CrowdSec Console.

There are two service level agreements (SLA) for chat support:

-   **Standard Support**: Included in the standard enterprise package.
-   **Premium Support**: Available as an upgrade for faster response times and prioritized support. [Learn more about Premium Support and pricing](https://www.crowdsec.net/pricing).

1. Log in to the CrowdSec Console.
2. Make sure you selected your enterprise grade organization in the organization switcher on the top left corner of the interface.
3. Locate the chat icon at the **bottom-right corner** of the interface.
