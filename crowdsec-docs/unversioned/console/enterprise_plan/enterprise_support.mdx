The CrowdSec Console now offers **Enterprise Support** for users on qualifying plans. This feature allows enterprise users to connect directly with our support team via a built-in chat within the CrowdSec Console.

There are two service level agreements (SLA) for chat support:

-   **Premium Support**: Console platform support with standard response times.
-   **Advance Support**: Comprehensive support including Console platform, Security Engines, Integrations, and all CrowdSec products with faster response times and extended support hours. [Learn more about Premium Support and pricing](https://www.crowdsec.net/pricing).

1. Log in to the CrowdSec Console.
2. Make sure you selected your enterprise grade organization in the organization switcher on the top left corner of the interface.
3. Locate the chat icon at the **bottom-right corner** of the interface.
