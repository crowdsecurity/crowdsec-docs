### IP Title and Status

The title section prominently displays the **IP address** and its **status**, indicating its current classification:

![CTI Report Title](/img/console/cti/report/title.png)

-   **<span className="text-red-600 dark:text-red-400">Malicious:</span>** The IP has been verified as actively malicious. Immediate remediation is recommended.
-   **<span className="text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400">Suspicious:</span>** This IP has been flagged in many reports and is a potential threat. Further investigation and use of CAPTCHA is recommended.
-   **<span className="text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">Known:</span>** This IP has been flagged in some reports but we don't have sufficient information yet to conclusively determine the threat level.
-   **<span className="text-cyan-600 dark:text-cyan-400">Benign:</span>** This IP has been flagged as benign and poses no threat.
-   **<span className="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400">Safe:</span>** This IP belongs to a legitimate service. Activity is not malicious.
-   **<span className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Unknown:</span>** This IP is either unknown or has not been reported in the past three months.

### Key Information

This section summarizes essential metadata about the IP, including:
