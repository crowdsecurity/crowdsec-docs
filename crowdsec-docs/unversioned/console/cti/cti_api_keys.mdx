This section will describe how to access to our CTI API and the different plans available.   
If you want to know more about the CTI API itself, you can check the [CTI API documentation](/u/cti_api/getting_started).

# Creating a CTI API Key

You can create a CTI API key via the** + ** short cut on the top right corner that will lead you to the CrowdSec Console settings, CTI API Key section.

# CTI Plans

The CTI API contains multiple endpoints that are not all accessible with any plan.   
The different plans are the following:

## Ip Lookup Plans
Those CTI API plans give you access to the search by IP and search query endpoints.   
They return CrowdSec CTI enriched information about IPS.   
IP returned will consume one token from your quota.

The CTI endpoint accessible with those keys are:
`/smoke/{ip}` and `/smoke/search`

The plans quotas are the following:
* Community CTI API Key (**1 free key** with a console account): **50 token/day**
* Extended CTI API Key: [contact us to activate an extended key for additional quota ↗️](https://www.crowdsec.net/contact-threat-intelligence-subscription)

## Advanced plans
Those CTI API plans extend access to all CTI API endpoints:
* `/smoke` : Allowing batch IP lookup
* `/fire`  : Allowing a paginated pull of all enriched IPs from our CrowdSec Intelligence Blocklist
