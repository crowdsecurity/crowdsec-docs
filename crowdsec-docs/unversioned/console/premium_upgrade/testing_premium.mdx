Before exploring all Premium features, here are practical ways to measure and experience the value yourself.
The following can be used as a guide during your trial period to assess the benefits of upgrading to Premium.

## 🎯 Measure Improved Protection

**Activate:**
- Community Blocklists (premium) will automatically be sent to your enrolled engines.
- The [Threat Forecast Blocklist](/u/console/threat_forecast) Will be generated automatically used in your organization based on your shared signals.
- Premium Tier Blocklists can be subscribed and subscription numbers per org are unlimited.
- You can activate [Remediation Sync](/u/console/remediation_sync) to propagate decisions across all your enrolled Security Engines.
- Respond faster to a spike of alerts thanks to "Am I Under Attack"

**Measure the impact:**
- **Remediation Metrics:** Track your proactive vs reactive blocking ratio
- **Server Resources:** Monitor CPU, memory, and bandwidth reduction
- **SIEM Logs:** Measure log volume decrease and background noise reduction

**Expected results:** 2x more proactive blocking, 75-92% less malicious traffic reaching your servers, cleaner logs and reduced alert fatigue.
