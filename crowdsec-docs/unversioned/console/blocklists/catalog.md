#  Blocklists catalog

To provide blocklists tailored to each need, CrowdSec has a wide catalog of blocklists, encompassing a variety of threat types and sources. This diversity allows to select and implement blocklists that best match their specific security requirements.
The search page in the CrowdSec Console provides a centralized interface to explore, subscribe, and manage blocklists tailored to enhance your organization’s security posture. This page allows to browse all available blocklists, find the ones most relevant to your needs, and activate them to protect your infrastructure.

The page is divided into several key sections, each serving a distinct purpose to simplify the process of managing blocklists:

**Top Section: Available Subscription Types Overview**  
This section displays the number of subscriptions remaining for the organization under each tier.
