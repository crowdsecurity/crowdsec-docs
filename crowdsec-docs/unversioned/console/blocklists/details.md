# Blocklist details

To help decide to install a blocklist on your infrastructure, many figures are provided to give a comprehensive view of the value provided by the Blocklist

  

### Popularity of the blocklist

  

The first section gives info about the popularity of the blocklist among CrowdSec users

  

*   A new feature to give the possibility to rate a blocklist when installed is under development
*   The number of users who have subscribed to the blocklist.
*   The last card shows the number of IPs present in the blocklist versus the number of IPs

The following metrics use two main approaches to demonstrate the overall quality of the data provided by the blocklist:

*   The frequency and impact of updates
*   The quality of the content can be composed of 4 different metrics:
    *   For third-party blocklists, the number of IPs removed due to being identified as false positives by CrowdSec.
    *   The quantity of IPs that are also present in the CrowdSec Intelligence blocklist (LINK to CSI explanation).
    *   The number of IPs that have been reportedly seen by CrowdSec agents.
    *   The amount of IPs unique to this blocklist, not found in any other blocklist.

The content of the blocklist is enriched against CrowdSec CTI to provide high-value meta-data about the most aggressive actors listed by the Blocklist.
