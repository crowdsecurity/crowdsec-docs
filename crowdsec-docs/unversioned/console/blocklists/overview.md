# Blocklists

## General overview

  

The blocklists are essentially compilations of IP addresses.

Most of these IP have been involved in different forms of cyberattacks, or have been active on potentially malicious networks (Tor nodes, proxy, VPN, etc ...).

  

The purpose of CrowdSec blocklists is to proactively protect your network and assets by preventing these unsafe actors from interacting with your systems. When an IP address is added to a blocklist, any attempts from it to access your infrastructure are automatically blocked.

  

Some of the CrowdSec blocklists are dynamically updated and enriched through the collaborative intelligence of the CrowdSec community. Each blocklist is the result of comprehensive analysis and community collaboration

  

  

## Blocklist catalog

  

To provide blocklists tailored to each need, CrowdSec has a wide catalog of blocklists, encompassing a variety of threat types and sources. This diversity allows to select and implement blocklists that best match specific security requirements.

The catalog is split into two distinct sections:

*   **The list of blocklists already installed on your infrastructure.**

To review the infrastructure status at a glance, In the lower part of each item are listed the Security Engines subscribed to this blocklist, and the type of remediation applied to the IPs.
