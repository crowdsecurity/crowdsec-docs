# Blocklists

## General overview

The blocklists are essentially compilations of IP addresses.

Most of these IPs have been involved in different forms of cyberattacks, or have been active on potentially malicious networks (Tor nodes, proxy, VPN, etc ...).

The purpose of CrowdSec blocklists is to proactively protect your network and assets by preventing these unsafe actors from interacting with your systems. When an IP address is added to a blocklist, any attempts from it to access your infrastructure are automatically blocked.

Some of the CrowdSec blocklists are dynamically updated and enriched through the collaborative intelligence of the CrowdSec community. Each blocklist is the result of comprehensive analysis and community collaboration
