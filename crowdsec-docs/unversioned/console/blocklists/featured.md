CrowdSec's new Blocklist Suggestions feature leverages advanced AI technology to enhance your organization's cybersecurity measures. By analyzing signals shared by enrolled Security Engines, this feature identifies and recommends the most effective Blocklists to protect against specific types of attacks targeting your infrastructure.

**Pre-requisites**  
For an organization to benefit from the Blocklist Suggestions feature, the following pre-requisites must be met:

* Security Engine must be enrolled in the CrowdSec ecosystem.
* Security Engine must actively share signals with the CrowdSec network.

**Feature Activation**  
The feature is automatically enabled for all CrowdSec users who meet the pre-requisites. No manual configuration is required to start receiving suggestions.

**Data Privacy and Usage**  
All data is processed internally by CrowdSec, with no third-party access. Only CrowdSec-owned systems handle the signals, ensuring that your data remains secure and private.

**Performance Metrics**  
To help gauge the impact of these suggestions, an indicator in the Console shows the potential reduction in alerts you can expect after installing the recommended Blocklists. This allows you to see at a glance how much benefit each suggested Blocklist might provide.

**Update Frequency**  
The AI analysis runs on a daily basis. Any newly suggested Blocklists appear automatically in the Console, reflecting the most recent attack patterns observed in your organization.

### Blocklist categorization

Under the Blocklist suggestions, another section regroups many CrowdSec Blocklists, grouped into main categories addressing different security needs.
These Blocklists are categorized to make it quick for users to navigate and identify the most relevant ones based on their infrastructure, industry, or attack patterns. By selecting the appropriate Blocklists, users can enhance their security defenses and proactively mitigate threats.
