# Blocklist Subscription

To begin the subscription process, click the _Subscribe_ button at the top of the blocklist details page. This will bring you to the bottom of the page, where you can subscribe to either Security Engines or integrations.

## Subscribe

### Security Engines
  
If your account already includes enrolled Security Engines, you'll find a section at the bottom that can also be used to start the subscription process.

When initiated, a popup displays all available subscription methods, including Security Engines and Blocklist-as-a-Service options.

The popup will allow you to configure which engines will subscribe to the blocklist and what remediation will be applied to the IPs listed that are trying to reach your server.

By default, all the eligible engines are selected.

Once an engine is subscribed, it will automatically receive all the blocklist data and stay updated when the blocklist content is refreshed.

The dashboard at the bottom of the page provides an advanced management of the blocklist subscriptions.

To interact with the engines subscribed, two options are available:

* To perform batch actions, the checkboxes can be used in combination with the selector
