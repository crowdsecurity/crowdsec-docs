## Why Upgrade to Premium?

CrowdSec Premium features are designed for users who have **commercial usage** of the Console or organizations that want to **enhance the security posture** of their infrastructure.  
While our Community Plan provides essential security monitoring capabilities, Premium unlocks advanced features that scale with your business needs and provide business-grade protection.

Premium features bring the following benefits:

- **Scalability**:
    - Extra centralization and synchronization features
    - Extended data retention
    - Automation and API access for large-scale deployments
- **Advanced Threat Detection & Qualification**:
    - Attack surge detection
    - Premium proactive blocking with AI-powered blocklists
    - Background noise filtering

A features comparison can be found on our [pricing page](https://app.crowdsec.net/pricing).

## Optimal Premium Upgrade Setup

When upgrading to a Premium plan, you may not want to upgrade every single Security Engine you monitor. It is common to have a mix of environments:
- **Production:** Requires Premium features (longer data retention, heavy API limits, organization-wide blocklists).
- **Dev / Test / Staging:** Can remain on the Free tier.

Because the Premium Upgrade applies to an entire **Organization**, the optimal strategy is to separate your Security Engines into different contexts before subscribing.

When you first create a Console account, your workspace is your "Personal Account".
As a community account, you can create one extra organization for free.  

We recommend the following setup:
- If you have not already, create a new organization for your **Production** environment.
- Keep your **Dev / Test / Staging** Security Engines in your **Personal Account**.
- Move your **Production** Security Engines to the new **Production** organization.
- Upgrade the **Production** organization to **Premium**.

To split your Security Engines into different organizations, use either:
- The [Transfer feature](/u/console/security_engines/transfer_engine) from the Security Engine page.
- Or via `cscli`, re-enroll your Security Engines in the desired organization with the `--overwrite` flag to force moving them to the new organization.

After the transfer, the alerts will reappear in the new organization after a few minutes.
