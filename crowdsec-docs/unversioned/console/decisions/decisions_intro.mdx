## Console Management

import { Badge } from "@site/src/ui/badge";

<div className="mb-4">
    <Badge variant="premium">CrowdSec Premium Feature</Badge>
</div>

The CrowdSec Security Engine is now able to receive instructions from the console.
This is done via a polling API, it means that the CrowdSec Local API will use long polling to get orders from the CrowdSec Console.
Currently, only 4 orders are available:

- Adding decisions from the console
- Delete decisions from the console
- Force pull the community-blocklist/third party list when an instance subscribe/unsubscribe to a blocklist in the Console
- Reauth to CAPI, when for example an instance is added to a tag

## Enable console management

:::info

Since CrowdSec v1.6.9, this flag is no longer required. CrowdSec will automatically detect the console plan in use and enable this option if needed.

It may take up to 30 minutes for CrowdSec to detect a plan upgrade or downgrade.

:::

We need to enable the option on the LAPI side:

```bash
sudo cscli console enable console_management
sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
```

The console_management is now enabled and our CrowdSec Security Engine is ready to receive orders from the CrowdSec Console.
