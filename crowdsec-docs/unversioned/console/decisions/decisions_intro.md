## Console Management

> ðŸŒŸ Premium feature

The CrowdSec Security Engine is now able to receive instructions from the console.
This is done via a polling API, it means that the CrowdSec Local API will use long polling to get orders from the CrowdSec Console.
Currently, only 4 orders are available:
 - Adding decisions from the console
 - Delete decisions from the console
 - Force pull the community-blocklist/third party list when an instance subscribe/unsubscribe to a blocklist in the Console
 - Reauth to CAPI, when for example an instance is added to a tag


## Enable console management

We need to enable the option on the LAPI side:
```bash
sudo cscli console enable console_management
sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
```

The console_management is now enabled and our CrowdSec Security Engine is ready to receive orders from the CrowdSec Console.
