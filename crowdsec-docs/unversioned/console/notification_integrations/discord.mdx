Connecting an integration will create a configuration specific to your Discord server.
You can then define rules to control which events trigger notifications and which Discord channel theyâ€™re sent to.

## Link your server

1. In the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net), navigate to **Settings > Integrations** and then select **Configure** in the Discord row.

2. Select the Discord server you want to link to your CrowdSec Console using the dropdown menu on top-tight of the page. Then select **Allow**. Repeat the process if you want to link more servers.

3. You should be redirected to the Discord integration page. You can now create a notification rule by navigating to the **Rules** tab.
