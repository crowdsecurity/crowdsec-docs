## Link your workspace

By default Slack let any workspace member add application to it. If you want to learn more about it you can check [this Slack article](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/202035138-Add-apps-to-your-Slack-workspace).

1. In the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net), navigate to **Settings > Integrations** and then select **Configure** in the Slack row.

2. Select the Slack workspace you want to link to your CrowdSec Console using the dropdown menu on top-tight of the page. Then select **Allow**. Repeat the process if you want to link more workspace.

3. You should be redirected to the Slack integration page. You can now create a notification rule by navigating to the **Rules** tab.

Your Slack integration is now linked to your CrowdSec Console. If you want to link the integration to a private channel, invite it directly from the Slack channel.

## Create a notification rule

1. In the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net), navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Slack** go to the Rules tab and click on **Add rule**.

2. Follow the steps in the [Create a notification rule](/u/console/notification_integrations/rule) documentation to create your rule.

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting Error

If you're attempting to create or update a notification rule and are receiving the following error: "Slack rate limit exceeded.", you should enter channel ID instead of the channel Name and wait for a minute. If your workspace has a lot of channels, we advise your to directly add the channel ID next time.

To find a channel's ID in Slack click the name of the channel at the top of the application and the channel ID will be displayed at the bottom of the modal.
