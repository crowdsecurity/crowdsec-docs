## Creating public blocklists

As you might have noticed in the [blocklist creation](https://admin.api.crowdsec.net/v1/docs#/Blocklists/createBlocklist) methods, there is a `public` flag that is set to `false` by default. We decided to manually vest any new public blocklist for the time being. If you want to share yours on the platform, you're more than welcome to reach us at `support *at* crowdsec.net`.
