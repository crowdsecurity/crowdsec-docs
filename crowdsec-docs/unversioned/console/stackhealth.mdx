- **Issue Detection**: Identifies problems with Security Engines, Log Processors, and blocklists integrations
- **Severity-Based Prioritization**: Issues are categorized by criticality *(Critical, Important, Recommended, Bonus)*
- **Contextual Troubleshooting**: Each issue points to a dedicated troubleshooting page with detailed diagnosis steps and resolution guidance
- **Notification Support**: Get notified about critical issues through the [Console notification system](/u/console/notification_integrations/overview)

- A list of issues in the Security Engine details view.

### Stack Health Dashboard

The dashboard shows:
- List of all detected issues in your organization grouped by criticality

## Understanding Issue Criticality

Stack Health categorizes issues into four severity levels:

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate attention required - core functionality is impaired |
| **Important** | Should be addressed soon - may impact protection effectiveness |
| **Recommended** | Additional actions to improve your security posture |
| **Bonus** | Optimization advice and premium feature recommendations |

Focus on resolving Critical and Important issues first to ensure your security stack is functioning properly.

## Issue Details and Resolution

Each issue detail page includes:

- **Trigger Condition**: Why the issue was raised

### Example: Security Engine No Alerts

When a Security Engine hasn't generated alerts in 48 hours, Stack Health provides:

- Possible root causes (simulation mode, missing collections, low traffic)
- Commands to verify scenario status
- Steps to check log acquisition and parsing
- Links to related documentation

- Set up [notifications](/u/console/notification_integrations/overview) for **Critical** and **Important** issues
- Review the full list of issues at least weekly

### Prioritize by Severity
1. Address **Critical** issues immediately - they indicate broken functionality
2. Plan to fix **Important** issues within 24-48 hours
3. Schedule **Recommended** improvements during maintenance windows
4. Explore **Bonus** optimizations when optimizing your setup
