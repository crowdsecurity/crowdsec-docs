:::info Beta Feature
This feature is currently in beta (v0.1).  It can be enabled from the Settings page under the Security Engines section for all Beta participants.
:::

## Introduction

Remediation Sync automatically synchronizes security decisions across your entire organization, ensuring consistent threat protection everywhere.  
All decisions from one Security Engine are automatically synced to all other Security Engines and your Blocklists-as-a-Service (BLaaS) endpoints, allowing for simple, consistent edge enforcement.

## How It Works

When one Security Engine detects and creates a decision about a threat, that decision is immediately propagated to:
- All other Security Engines in your organization
- Your Blocklists-as-a-Service (BLaaS) endpoints

This ensures that once a threat is identified anywhere in your infrastructure, it's blocked everywhere.

> In the current version, Remediation Sync shares across the whole organization.  
> Future versions will allow more granular control over which Security Engines share decisions to what other Security Engines or BLaaS endpoints.

## Enabling Remediation Sync

To enable this feature:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your CrowdSec Console
2. Go to the **Security Engines** section
3. Toggle the **Remediation Sync** option to **ON**
