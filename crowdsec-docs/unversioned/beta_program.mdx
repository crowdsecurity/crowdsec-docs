# Upcoming Betas

## WAAP component Beta

### What is CrowdSec WAAP

The upcoming **CrowdSec WAAP** *(Web Application & API Protection)* is built to enhance your defense against malicious activities. 
To achieve this, the CrowdSec WAAP channels request data through the behavior engine, broadening vulnerability detection to encompass the full range of exploits via ingress traffic. 
Alongside our comprehensive collection of WAAP rules, we offer the flexibility to craft your own using our intuitive and robust rule language/model. This feature empowers you to customize WAAP to fit your particular security needs.


CrowdSec WAAP will integrate seamlessly with our existing web servers and proxy Remediation Components, including Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik Proxy, Apache, and more. 

**Important note**: During the beta phase, WAAP is exclusively available for the Nginx Remediation Component. (+link to component)
