## Upcoming Betas

### Remediation Sync - Closed Beta starting October 10, 2025

#### What is it and what to expect?

**Remediation Sync** enables automatic synchronization of security decisions across your entire CrowdSec infrastructure. Any decision from one Security Engine is automatically synced to all other Security Engines and your Blocklist-as-a-Service (BLaaS) endpoints, allowing for simple, consistent edge enforcement across your organization.

This feature provides:
- Centralized decision management across multiple Security Engines
- Automatic propagation of blocking decisions to all enforcement points
- Consistent security posture across distributed infrastructures
- Simplified management of complex multi-site deployments

#### Who will have access to it?

This is a closed beta program. If you're interested in participating, reply to our beta invitation email with one short sentence on how this would improve your CrowdSec setup. We'll activate the feature on your organization once selected.

#### How it works:
- Decisions made by any Security Engine in your organization are automatically shared
- All connected Security Engines receive and apply these decisions
- BLaaS endpoints are updated to include the synchronized decisions
- Provides unified protection across your entire infrastructure

### CrowdSec Threat Forecast Blocklist - Beta starts 2024-10-25 

#### What is it and what to expect?

The **Threat Forecast Blocklist** is a dynamic, adaptive blocklist customized to your organization's signals.  
By identifying attacks on similar profiles, it predicts threats that will likely target your organization in the coming days.  
It will update every 24 hours, and the signals of all your Security Engines will be considered to build the prediction.  

It's tailored to your organization; hence, we expect that it should allow preemptive remediation, resulting in a **drop in the number of alerts**.   
Optionally, if you have an iptables of nftables remediation component, you'll be able to see some [metrics about this blocklist's efficiency](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/observability/usage_metrics)

#### Who will have access to it?

If you have at least one enrolled security engine with an average of more than 100 alerts a week (total for your organization) you have a chance to be invited.  
You'll receive an email on Friday, October the 25th, 2024.

**Important note**: You will have 15 days to start using the Threat Forecast Blocklist and 30 days in total starting today to test it out. If you do not use it within 15 days, your access will be reallocated to someone else.

#### How to subscribe to this blocklist

- Log into your console account
- Go to the blocklist catalog and search "forecast": https://app.crowdsec.net/blocklists?page=1&q=forecast
  - If you're part of the this beta, you should see the **Threat Forecast Blocklist**
  - Click on it
- You should have landed in the details page for this blocklist
- Click on subscribe to open the subscription popup and follow its instructions to subscribe to the blocklist. 
  - We recommend subscribing your organization to the list as this will make sure that newly added security engines automatically benefit from the blocklist as well. 
  -- If you want to have more finegrained controll, you can also select only specific engines to subscribe to the list.
- Click confirm subscription

Note that you must have a [remediation component](https://doc.crowdsec.net/u/bouncers/intro) on those engines to effectively block the IPs.
