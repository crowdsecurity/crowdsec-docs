## Upcoming Betas

### CrowdSec Threat Forecast Blocklist - Beta starts 2024-10-25 

#### What is it ?

The Threat Forecast Blocklist is a dynamic, adaptive blocklist customized to your organization's signals. By identifying attacks on similar profiles, it predicts threats that will likely target your organization in the coming days. 

The Threat Forecast Blocklist will update every 24 hours, and the signals of all your Security Engines will be considered to build the prediction.

#### Who will have access to it ?

If you have at least one enrolled security engine with an average of more than 100 alerts a week (total on your organization) you have a chance to be invited.  
You'll receive an email on Friday October the 25th 2024.

**Important note**: You will have 15 days to start using the Threat Forecast Blocklist and 30 days total starting today to test it out. If you do not use it within 15 days, your access will be reallocated to someone else.

## Your feedback is key

As one of the first testers of the Threat Forecast Blocklist, your insights are crucial. Join the #beta-program channel on Discord, to share your experience and connect with fellow Beta Program members. At the end of the testing period, we'll also send a brief survey to gather your feedback.
