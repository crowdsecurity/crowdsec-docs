## Upcoming Betas

### CrowdSec Threat Forecast Blocklist - Beta starts 2024-10-25 

#### What is it and what to expect?

The **Threat Forecast Blocklist** is a dynamic, adaptive blocklist customized to your organization's signals.  
By identifying attacks on similar profiles, it predicts threats that will likely target your organization in the coming days.  
It will update every 24 hours, and the signals of all your Security Engines will be considered to build the prediction.  

It's tailored to your organization; hence, we expect that it should allow preemptive remediation, resulting in a **drop in the number of alerts**.   
Optionally, if you have an iptables of nftables remediation component, you'll be able to see some [metrics about this blocklist's efficiency](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/observability/usage_metrics)

#### Who will have access to it?

If you have at least one enrolled security engine with an average of more than 100 alerts a week (total for your organization) you have a chance to be invited.  
You'll receive an email on Friday, October the 25th, 2024.

**Important note**: You will have 15 days to start using the Threat Forecast Blocklist and 30 days in total starting today to test it out. If you do not use it within 15 days, your access will be reallocated to someone else.
