## Upcoming Betas

### CrowdSec AppSec component - Beta

#### What is it ?

This upcoming new features on some of our front facing components is meant to enhance your defense against malicious activities.
The AppSec capabilities, primarily aimed at virtual patching, will allow you to turn your CrowdSec install into a full fledged WAF (Web Application Firewall)

To achieve this, the component will channel request data through the behavior engine, broadening vulnerability detection to encompass the full range of exploits via ingress traffic. 
Alongside our comprehensive collection of WAF rules, we offer the flexibility to craft your own using our intuitive and robust rule language/model. This feature empowers you to customize your WAF to fit your particular security needs.

This feature will integrate seamlessly with our existing web servers and proxy Remediation Components, including Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik Proxy, Apache, and more. 

**Important note**: During the beta phase, this feature is exclusively available for the Nginx Remediation Component. (*link coming soon, when beta is out !*)
