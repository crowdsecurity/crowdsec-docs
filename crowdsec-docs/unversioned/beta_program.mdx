# Upcoming Betas

## WAAP component Beta

### What is CrowdSec WAAP

The upcoming **CrowdSec WAAP** *(Web Application & API Protection)* is set to enhance your defense against malicious activities. 
It achieves this by channeling request data through parsers and scenarios, broadening vulnerability detection to encompass the full range of exploits via ingress traffic.
Alongside our comprehensive collection of WAAP rules, we offer the flexibility to craft your own using our intuitive and robust rule language/model. This feature empowers you to tailor your security needs precisely.

CrowdSec WAAP will integrate seamlessly with our existing web servers and proxy remediation components, including Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, and Apache,....
However, during the beta phase, it will be exclusively available for our NGINX bouncer.(link to bouncer)
