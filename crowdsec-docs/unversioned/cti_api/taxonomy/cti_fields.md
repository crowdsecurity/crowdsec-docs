## `ip`

> type: **string**

```json
"ip": "1.2.3.4"
```

The requested IP.

## `ip_range`

> type: **string**

```json
"ip_range": "1.2.3.0/18"
```

The range to which the IP belongs.

## `reputation`

> type: **string**

```json
"reputation" : "malicious"
```

The reputation of the IP address.

The possible values are:

- `malicious` : The IP address is malicious
- `suspicious` : Many CrowdSec users have reported the IP, but it is not aggressive enough to be considered malicious
- `known` : At this time, the CrowdSec network has identified the IP, but we still require additional information to make a decision
- `safe` : The IP address is safe and can be trusted (ex: Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS ...)
- `unknown`: The IP address is either unknown or its last report is from more than three months ago

## `ip_range_24`

> type: **string**

```json
"ip_range_24" : "1.2.3.0/24"
```

The /24 range of the IP address.

## `ip_range_24_reputation`

> type: **string**

```json
"ip_range_24_reputation" : "malicious"
```

For range reputation, only the IPs in the immediate proximity of the requested IP address are considered. For convenience, the range (network prefix) size is always fixed to /24, or 256 IPv4 addresses.

The possible values for the /24 network prefix are:

- `malicious` : The range is considered malicious
- `suspicious` : The IP range contains several IPs that have been reported by the CrowdSec network
- `known` : The IP range is recognized in the CrowdSec network, but we lack sufficient sightings of its IP addresses
- `unknown`: The last report for IP range is either unknown or over 3 months old

## `ip_range_24_score`

> type: **string**

```json
"ip_range_24_score" : 4
```

For range scoring, only the IPs in the immediate proximity of the requested IP address are considered. For convenience, the range (network prefix) size is always fixed to /24, or 256 IPv4 addresses.

0 represents unknown, 1 represents a few reported IPs, and 5 represents the highest level for the most aggressive range

Here is the mapping with the reputation:

| Score | Reputation   |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 0     | `unknown`    |
| 1-2   | `known`      |
| 3     | `suspicious` |
| 4-5   | `malicious`  |

## `background_noise`

> type: **string**

```json
"background_noise" : "malicious"
```

The level of background noise of an IP address is an indicator of its internet activity intensity.

The possible values are:

- `high` : IP is very noisy
- `medium` : IP has been reported by many members of the CrowdSec network, but not enough to be considered as background noise
- `low` : IP has been reported by a few members of the CrowdSec network
- `none` : IP has never been reported or only by a very few members of the CrowdSec network

## `background_noise_score`

> type: **int**
