IPs in this category may raise alerts, but they are not inherently dangerous. These IPs often belong to organizations that perform legitimate activities, such as internet-wide scanning or security research.

IPs belonging to those categories will have the `benign` [reputation](/u/cti_api/taxonomy/cti_object#reputation).

:::note

Blocking these IPs may not be necessary unless their behavior directly impacts your operations.
