## What is the Live Exploit Tracker

The **Live Exploit Tracker** allows you to interact with CrowdSec's Threat Intelligence data, specifically focusing on CVEs and the IPs that exploit them. This enables you to prioritize vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitation data and mitigate threats by integrating IOCs with your existing security infrastructure: firewalls, SIEM, SOAR etc.

:::info
Live Exploit Tracker can be used via a web interface, or via the RESTful API.
:::

## What to expect

The Exploit Tracker API and Web applications allows you to:
 - Get information related to specific CVE(s) as observed by the CrowdSec Network, helping you to **prioritize**.
 - Get CTI data and IPs actively exploiting a specific CVE(s) for **mitigation** or threat hunting.
 - Create and maintain **blocklists** of IPs exploiting specific vulnerabilities that can be easily integrated into most **firewalls**.

### Prioritize

For a CVE, get:
 - **General CVE information**: Name, Title, Affected Components, CWEs, References, CVSS score, Presence of known public exploit etc.
 - Number of IPs actively exploiting the vulnerability.
 - **CrowdSec Analysis**: A human readable text covering the most important information about the vulnerability:
    - Technical description of the vulnerability
    - Relevant information about payload such as targeted URI
    - Description of exploitation patterns, from targeted to large-scale opportunistic attacks
 - **CrowdSec Scores**:
    - CrowdSec Live Exploit Tracker Score: The higher the score, the stronger is the momentum around the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities that have been exploited for a while or opportunsticly will get a lower score.
    - Exploitation Status: The current exploitation status of the vulnerability, from "early exploitation" to "background noise".
 - **Timeline information**:
    - First and Last exploitation observed
    - CVE Publication date, Detection rule Publication date, CISA KEV addition etc.
    - List of general events related to the CVE and its exploitation status.

### Mitigate

From a CVE, get related IPs for different usecases:

**CTI Information**
 - List of IPs exploiting the vulnerability over a given period, with [their associated information](https://doc.crowdsec.net/u/cti_api/taxonomy/cti_object), from reputation to known classifications. Allows to differentiate legitimate scanning actors (ie. shodan etc.), well-known attackers and newly deployed infrastructures.

**Blocklists**
 - Create *integrations* allowing blocklist consumption from various firewall vendors.
 - Subscribe *integrations* to CVEs, effectively blocking suspicious and malicious IPs known to actively exploit the vulnerability.

## Web interface

### Prerequisites

To access the Exploit Tracker API, you need an API key. Please contact the CrowdSec team to obtain your API key if you haven't already.

### Access

Connect to https://let-demo.dev.crowdsec.net/ and put your provided API key in the top right field.

## API

### Prerequisites

To access the Exploit Tracker API, you need an API key. Please contact the CrowdSec team to obtain your API key if you haven't already.

:::info
You can use our python SDK: `pip install crowdsec-tracker-api`
:::

### Authentication

To interact with the API, you need to configure the authentication using your API key.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import ApiKeyAuth, Server

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Define the Server URL
base_url = Server.production_server.value
```

## Quick Example: Get CVE Information

Here is a simple example of how to retrieve information about a specific CVE using the SDK.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="python"
  groupId="tracker-api-intro-selection"
  values={[
    { label: 'cURL', value: 'curl' ,},
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl -i -H "x-api-key: ${KEY}" -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://admin.api.crowdsec.net/v1/cves/CVE-2024-25600
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import Cves, ApiKeyAuth, Server
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Cves service
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

# Get CVE Details
cve_id = "CVE-2024-25600"
try:
    cve_details = cves_service.get_cve(cve_id)
    print(f"CVE: {cve_details.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>answer on success</summary>

```json
{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-25600",
  "description": "Description of the CVE...",
  "severity": "High",
  "exploit_count": 42,
  "first_seen": "2024-01-15T12:34:56Z",
  "last_seen": "2024-06-10T08:22:33Z"
  ... other fields ...
}
```
