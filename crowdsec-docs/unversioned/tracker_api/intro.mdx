## What is the Exploit Tracker API?

The **Exploit Tracker API** allows you to interact with CrowdSec's Threat Intelligence data, specifically focusing on CVEs and the IPs that exploit them. This enables you to prioritize vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitation data and mitigate threats by integrating with your existing security infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

To access the Exploit Tracker API, you need an API key. Please contact the CrowdSec team to obtain your API key if you haven't already.

## Installation

First, install the CrowdSec Tracker API SDK:

```bash
pip install crowdsec-tracker-api
```

## Authentication

To interact with the API, you need to configure the authentication using your API key.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import ApiKeyAuth, Server

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Define the Server URL
base_url = Server.production_server.value
```

## Quick Example: Get CVE Information

Here is a simple example of how to retrieve information about a specific CVE using the SDK.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import Cves, ApiKeyAuth, Server
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Cves service
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

# Get CVE Details
cve_id = "CVE-2025-1324"
try:
    cve_details = cves_service.get_cve(cve_id)
    print(f"CVE: {cve_details.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
```

<details>
  <summary>answer on success</summary>

```json
{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-1234",
  "description": "Description of the CVE...",
  "severity": "High",
  "exploit_count": 42,
  "first_seen": "2024-01-15T12:34:56Z",
  "last_seen": "2024-06-10T08:22:33Z"
  ... other fields ...
}
```

</details>
