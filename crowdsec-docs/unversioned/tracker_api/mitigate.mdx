The **Mitigate** features allow you to take action on the threat intelligence you've gathered. You can create integrations with your security infrastructure (like firewalls) and subscribe them to receive updates about specific CVEs.

## Manage Integrations

Integrations are the bridge between CrowdSec's data and your security systems. You can create integrations that output data in various formats suitable for different firewalls and remediation components.

### Create an Integration

To create an integration, you need to specify its name, type, and output format.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import (
    Integrations,
    IntegrationCreateRequest,
    IntegrationType,
    OutputFormat,
    Server,
    ApiKeyAuth,
)
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Integrations service
integrations_service = Integrations(auth=auth)

# Create the request
request = IntegrationCreateRequest(
    name="My Firewall Integration",
    description="fetch cves ips lists",
    entity_type=IntegrationType.FIREWALL_INTEGRATION.value,
    output_format=OutputFormat.PLAIN_TEXT.value,
)

# Create the integration
try:
    response = integrations_service.create_integration(request=request)
    print(f"Integration Created: {response.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
# IMPORTANT: Save the Client Secret securely, it is only shown once!
```

### List Integrations

You can list all your existing integrations to manage them.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import (
    Integrations,
    Server,
    ApiKeyAuth,
)
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Integrations service
integrations_service = Integrations(auth=auth)

try:
    response = integrations_service.get_integrations()

    for integration in response.items:
        print(integration.model_dump_json(indent=2))
        print("-----")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")

```

### Update an Integration

You can update the details of an existing integration, such as its name, description, or regenerate its client secret.

```python
import os
from httpx import HTTPStatusError
from crowdsec_tracker_api import (
    Integrations,
    Server,
    ApiKeyAuth,
    IntegrationUpdateRequest,
)

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Integrations service
integrations_service = Integrations(auth=auth)

integration_id = "abcdefgh12345678"  # Replace with your integration ID
request = IntegrationUpdateRequest(
    name="Updated Firewall Integration",
    regenerate_credentials=True,
    description="Updated description for the integration",
)
try:
    response = integrations_service.update_integration(
        integration_id=integration_id,
        request=request,
    )
    print(f"Integration Updated: {response.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
```

### Delete an Integration

If an integration is no longer needed, you can delete it.

```python
import os
from httpx import HTTPStatusError
from crowdsec_tracker_api import (
    Integrations,
    Server,
    ApiKeyAuth,
)

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Integrations service
integrations_service = Integrations(auth=auth)

# Create the integration
try:
    response = integrations_service.delete_integration(
        integration_id="abcdefgh12345678"  # Replace with your integration ID
    )
    print("Integration deleted successfully.")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")

```

## Subscribe CVE to Integration

Once you have an integration, you can subscribe it to a specific CVE. This means the integration will receive the list of IPs exploiting that CVE.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import (
    Cves,
    Server,
    ApiKeyAuth,
    SubscribeCVEIntegrationRequest,
)
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Initialize the service
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

cve_id = "CVE-2024-1234"
integration_name = "My Firewall Integration"  # The name of the integration you created

# Create subscription request
request = SubscribeCVEIntegrationRequest(name=integration_name)

# Subscribe
try:
    response = cves_service.subscribe_integration_to_cve(request=request, cve_id=cve_id)
    print(response)
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
```

## Unsubscribe Integration from CVE

If you no longer want an integration to receive updates for a CVE, you can unsubscribe it.

```python
import os
from httpx import HTTPStatusError
from crowdsec_tracker_api import (
    Cves,
    Server,
    ApiKeyAuth,
)

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Initialize the service
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

cve_id = "CVE-2024-1234"
integration_name = "My Firewall Integration"  # The name of the integration you created

# Unsubscribe
try:
    response = cves_service.unsubscribe_integration_from_cve(
        cve_id=cve_id, integration_name=integration_name
    )
    if response is None:
        print(
            f"Successfully unsubscribed integration '{integration_name}' from CVE '{cve_id}'."
        )
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")

```

## Next Steps

Now that you have set up integrations and subscribed them to CVEs, you can follow [this documentation guide](https://docs.crowdsec.net/u/integrations/intro) to configure your security appliance based on the integration you created.
