## Objective

The [Web Interface of Live Exploit Tracker](https://let-demo.dev.crowdsec.net/) allows you to consume the API in a more human friendly way, and exposes the same features.

 - View CVEs information: timeline, activity trends, related IPs.
 - Mitigate exploitation attempts by preemptively blocking IPs known to exploit given vulnerabilitilies.

## Prioritize

The prioritize feature allows you to list or search tracked CVEs, and view detailed CVEs information:

## Mitigate

From a CVE page, you are able to view IPs exploiting the vulnerability:

You can subscribe a firewall integration to a CVE, blocking IPs exploiting that vulnerability:

## Firewall Integrations

The firewall integration page lets you view and create integrations:
