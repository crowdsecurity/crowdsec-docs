The **Prioritize** features allow you to assess the threat level of vulnerabilities by providing visibility into which CVEs are actively being exploited and by whom.

## List Tracked CVEs

You can retrieve a paginated list of all CVEs that CrowdSec is currently tracking. This helps you identify which vulnerabilities in your environment might be under active exploitation.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import Cves, Server, ApiKeyAuth
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Initialize the service
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

# Get list of CVEs
try:
    response = cves_service.get_cves(page=1, size=50)

    for cve in response.items:
        print(cve.model_dump_json(indent=2))
        print("-----")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")

```

## Get CVE Details

Get detailed information about a specific CVE, including its description and CVSS score.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import Cves, ApiKeyAuth, Server
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Cves service
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

# Get CVE Details
cve_id = "CVE-2024-1234"
try:
    cve_details = cves_service.get_cve(cve_id)
    print(f"CVE: {cve_details.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
```

## Get IPs Targeting a CVE

One of the most powerful features is the ability to see the IP addresses that are actively exploiting a specific CVE. This information allows you to block these IPs immediately.

```python
import os
from crowdsec_tracker_api import Cves, ApiKeyAuth, Server
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

KEY = os.getenv("KEY")

# Configure Authentication
auth = ApiKeyAuth(api_key=KEY)

# Initialize the Cves service
cves_service = Cves(auth=auth)

# Get CVE Details
cve_id = "CVE-2024-1234"
try:
    response = cves_service.get_cve_ips(cve_id, page=1, size=10)
except HTTPStatusError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")

for ip in response.items:
    print(ip.model_dump_json(indent=2))
    print("-----")

```
