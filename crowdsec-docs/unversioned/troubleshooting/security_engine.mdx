### How to know if my setup is working correctly ? Some of my logs are unparsed, is it normal ?

Yes, Security Engine parsers only parse the logs that are relevant for scenarios.

Take a look at `cscli metrics` [and understand what do they mean](/docs/next/observability/cscli) to know if your setup is correct.

You can take an extra step and use [`cscli explain` to understand what log lines are parsed, and how.](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_explain) :

![cscli-explain](/img/cscli_explain.png)

### Why are X logs not parsed in `cscli metrics` ?

If you are facing logs that doesn't seem to be parsed correctly, please use [`cscli explain`](/docs/cscli/cscli_explain) :

```
# cscli explain --log "May 16 07:50:30 sd-126005 sshd[10041]: Invalid user git from 78.142.18.204 port 47738" --type syslog
line: May 16 07:50:30 sd-126005 sshd[10041]: Invalid user git from 78.142.18.204 port 47738

		â”œ ðŸŸ¢ crowdsecurity/ssh-slow-bf
		â”” ðŸŸ¢ crowdsecurity/ssh-slow-bf_user-enum
```

This command will allow you to see each parser behavior.

:::warning
Do **not** use `cscli explain` on big log files, as this command will buffer a lot of information in memory to achieve this.
If you want to check crowdsec's behaviour on big log files, please see [replay mode](/u/user_guides/replay_mode/).
:::

### I want to add collection X : how to add log files, and how to test if it works ?

When adding a collection to your setup, the [hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) will usually specify log files to add.

## Decisions

### How to list current decisions

```bash
cscli decisions list
```

Additional filtering is possible please read [cscli decisions list](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_decisions_list) for more information.

### How to remove a decision on a IP

```bash
cscli decisions delete -i x.x.x.x
```
Additional filtering is possible please read [cscli decisions delete](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_decisions_delete) for more information.

### How to control granularity of decisions

The Security Engine is designed to be as flexible as possible, and allows you to control the granularity of decisions.

[Profiles](/docs/next/local_api/profiles/intro) allows you to control which decision will be applied to which alert.

### How to add whitelists or prevent the Security Engine from banning a given IP

The recommanded ways to prevent specific IP being banned:
 - [Use Centralized AllowLists](/docs/next/local_api/centralized_allowlists) - Works on local decisions, blocklists and can be controlled from the Console.
 - [Custom Profiles](/docs/next/local_api/profiles/intro) - Applies to local alerts before Local API applies a decision.
 - [Parser Whitelists](/docs/next/log_processor/whitelist/intro) - Applies directly on the log parsing pipeline.

#### I need to whitelist an event pattern instead of a single IP address

You can exclude specific events [using whitelist parsers](/docs/next/log_processor/whitelist/intro).
It can be used to discard events based on a specific URL, source IP adress or any other condition.

## Scenarios

### Scenario X keeps triggering, it's a false trigger

To avoid false positives from a known scenario, you can use:
 - [Parser Whitelists](/docs/next/log_processor/whitelist/intro) - Applies directly on the log parsing pipeline.
 - [Custom Profiles](/docs/next/local_api/profiles/intro) - Applies to local alerts before Local API applies a decision.

### Set a custom/tainted scenario in simulation mode

If you want to set a custom/tainted scenario in simulation mode, you need to provide the scenario's filename instead of its name.

For example, i have a scenario called `crowdsecurity/my-custom-scenario`Â located in `{config_dir}/scenarios/my_custom_scenario.yaml`.

:::info
Please see [configuration section](#where-is-configuration-stored) to see where the file will be located on your system.
:::

To enable the simulation mode for this scenario, run:

<FormattedTabs
  bash="sudo cscli simulation enable my_custom_scenario.yaml"
  powershell="cscli.exe simulation enable my_custom_scenario.yaml"
  k8s="kubectl exec -it crowdsec-agent-* -n crowdsec -- cscli simulation enable my_custom_scenario.yaml"
/>

### My scenario is triggered with less logs than the scenario capacity

When you install CrowdSec, the CrowdSec Wizard runs automatically to find and add basic log files to the acquisition configuration. If you run the 'wizard.sh' script again after installing and you have common log files, they might be added multiple times to your acquisition configuration. This causes CrowdSec to read each log line as many times as the file is configured in the acquisition settings.

Please review your acquisition files and remove any duplicate log entires.

### Is scenario X working on my logs ?

To test if logs are correctly parsed and checked by scenarios, use:
 - [Replay mode](/u/user_guides/replay_mode/) allows you to process cold logs and see scenarios triggered.
 - [`cscli explain`](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_explain) allows you to inspect the parsing process for one or more log lines.

## Configuration

### Where is configuration stored?

See [CrowdSec Configuration](/docs/next/configuration/crowdsec_configuration).

### Where is data stored?

CrowdSec stores its data in `/var/lib/crowdsec/data/` folder for UNIX and `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\data\` for Windows.

This is where the default sqlite database and data files needed for scenarios are kept.

### Which databases does the Security Engine support and how to switch ?

Security Engine versions supports SQLite (default), MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
See [databases configuration](/docs/next/local_api/database) for relevant configuration. Thanks to the [Local API](/docs/next/local_api/intro), distributed architectures are resolved even with sqlite database.

### Multi-server setup

For multi-server setup, please pick one of the follow:
 - [distributed architecture](/u/user_guides/multiserver_setup).
 - [log centralization approach](/u/user_guides/log_centralization)

## Logs

### Where are the logs stored?

By default CrowdSec will log to the following locations depending on platform:

- **Linux** `/var/log/crowdsec.log`
- **Freebsd** `/var/log/crowdsec.log`
  - **Opnsense** `/var/log/crowdsec/crowdsec.log`
  - **Pfsense** `/var/log/crowdsec/crowdsec.log`
- **Windows** `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log`
- **Kubernetes** `kubectl logs -n crowdsec crowdsec-(agent|lapi)-*`

This is the default log location if you are using a third party integration they may change the log location.

:::info
If you are unsure where CrowdSec is logging you can view the configuration file `config.yaml` and look for `log_dir` to see the configured location.
:::

### Filtering logs to only show errors

You can use the os related commands to filter the logs to only show errors.

<FormattedTabs
    bash='sudo grep -E "level=(error|fatal)" /var/log/crowdsec.log'
    cmd='findstr "level=error level=fatal" C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log'
    powershell='Select-String "level=(error|fatal)" C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log'
    k8s='kubectl logs -n crowdsec crowdsec-agent-* | grep -E "level=(error|fatal)"'
/>

**Please make sure the log location matches your distribution.**

## Common Errors

:::info
If it's a configuration file issue, the error message may log in a different location. As an example, if a parser/scenario file is invalid, the error message will be logged within the configured log file, however, if `config.yaml` is invalid, the error message will be logged in syslog instead.
:::

### Cannot bind to the configured port or IP
  - **error** message might look like:
```
level=fatal msg="while serving local API: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: bind: address already in use"
```
  - **solution** verify another service is not already using the port or ip address + port combination. If it is, you can edit the `listen_uri` in the configuration file `config.yaml` and update `local_api_credentials.yaml` to the same value. Then you can restart CrowdSec with `sudo systemctl restart crowdsec`.

### Cannot authenticate to the local API
  - **error** message might look like:
```
level=fatal msg="starting outputs error : authenticate watcher (fcb7303c4df44c03ada289dd7ec3dbe7cU3GaseSWdqUaVg6): API error: ent: machine not found"
```
  - **solution** regenerate the credentials via [cscli machines](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_machines_add) command. If the local API is on the same machine you can run `sudo cscli machines add -a` (`-a` will automatically generate a random machine name and password). Then you can restart CrowdSec with `sudo systemctl restart crowdsec`.

### Cannot connect to the local API
  - **error** message might look like:
```
level=error msg="error while performing request: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused; 4 retries left"
```
:::info
There may be other variations of this error message just note if the message contains `connection refused` or `connection reset by peer` or `no such host` its likely a connection issue or configuration.
:::
  - **solution** verify that the local API runs on the logged IP and port. If the logged IP and port is incorrect, you can update `/etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml` to the correct IP and port (If local API is running on the same machine you can run `grep listen_uri /etc/crowdsec/config.yaml` to find it). Then you can restart CrowdSec with `sudo systemctl restart crowdsec`. If the logged IP and port is correct, verify that the local API is running via `sudo systemctl status crowdsec`.

### Cannot start because of an invalid configuration file

  - **error** message might look like:
```
level=fatal msg="/etc/crowdsec/config.yaml: yaml: unmarshal errors:\n  line 1: field test not found in type csconfig.Config"
```
  - **solution** CrowdSec will inform you which field or line is invalid. You can edit the configuration file and fix the error. Then you can restart CrowdSec with `sudo systemctl restart crowdsec`. If you are unsure what the configuration file should look like you can find the default configuration files [here](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/tree/master/config) or examples via the [documentation](/docs/configuration/crowdsec_configuration).

## General Questions

### What is CrowdSec Security Engine ?

CrowdSec Security Engine is a open-source security software. See the [overview](/docs/next/intro).

### What language is it written in ?

CrowdSec Security Engine is written in [Golang](https://golang.org/).

### What resources are needed to run Security Engine ?

Security Engine itself is rather light, and in a small to medium setup should use less than 100Mb of memory.

During intensive logs processing, CPU is going to be the most used resource, and memory should grow slightly.

#### What is the performance impact ?

As the Security Engine only works on logs, it shouldn't impact your production.
When it comes to [remediation components](/u/bouncers/intro), please refer to their [documentation](/u/bouncers/intro).


### How to set up proxy

Setting up a proxy works out of the box, the [net/http golang library](https://golang.org/src/net/http/transport.go) can handle those environment variables:

-   `HTTP_PROXY`
-   `HTTPS_PROXY`
-   `NO_PROXY`

For example:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy_url>:<proxy_port>
```

#### Systemd variable

On Systemd devices you have to set the proxy variable in the environment section for the CrowdSec service. To avoid overwriting the service file during an update, a folder is created in `/etc/systemd/system/crowdsec.service.d` and a file in it named `http-proxy.conf`. The content for this file should look something like this:

```bash title="systemctl edit crowdsec.service"
[Service]
Environment=HTTP_PROXY=http://myawesomeproxy.com:8080
Environment=HTTPS_PROXY=https://myawesomeproxy.com:443
Environment=NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,0.0.0.0
```

After this change you need to reload the systemd daemon using:
`systemctl daemon-reload`

Then you can restart CrowdSec like this:
`systemctl restart crowdsec`

#### Sudo

If you use `sudo cscli`, just add this line in `visudo` after setting up the previous environment variables:

```
Defaults        env_keep += "HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY NO_PROXY"
```

### Tor

You can configure `cscli` and `crowdsec` to use [tor](https://www.torproject.org/) to anonymously interact with our API.

All (http) requests made to the central API to go through the [tor network](https://www.torproject.org/).

With tor installed, setting `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables to your socks5 proxy, as well as setting `NO_PROXY` to local addresses to prevent LAPI errors, will do the trick.

#### Edit crowdsec systemd unit to push/pull via tor

```bash title="systemctl edit crowdsec.service"
[Service]
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"
Environment="NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,0.0.0.0"
```

#### Running the wizard with tor

```bash
$ sudo HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 HTTP_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,0.0.0.0  ./wizard.sh --bininstall
```

:::caution

Do not use the wizard in interactive (`-i`) mode if you're concerned, as it will start the service at the end of the setup, leaking your IP address.

:::

#### cscli

```bash
$ sudo HTTP_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,0.0.0.0 cscli capi register
```


### How to disable the central API

To disable the central API, simply comment out the [`online_client` section of the configuration file](/docs/next/configuration/crowdsec_configuration#online_client).
