## Block Known-Bad IPs at the Edge

**What this solves:** Stop commodity scanners, botnets and repeat offenders at the network edge before they reach your services.

### Firewall Integration

* **Appliance Integration**
  * [OPNsense plugin setup](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec_opnsense)
  * [FreeBSD/pfSense installation](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec_freebsd)
  * [Managing bouncers with cscli](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_bouncers)

* **OS Firewall Integration**
  * Configure your system firewall to consume CrowdSec decisions
  * Use blocklist integrations for automated IP blocking

### Reverse Proxy/WAF Integration

* **NGINX Reverse Proxy**
  * [WAF reverse proxy setup guide](/u/user_guides/waf_rp_howto)
  * [AppSec configuration](/docs/next/appsec/configuration)
  * [NGINX bouncer documentation](/u/bouncers/nginx)

* **CDN/WAF Integration**
  * Configure your CDN or WAF to consume CrowdSec blocklists
  * Use bouncer components for real-time blocking

### Security Engine Integration

* **Blocklist Subscriptions**
  * [Monitor with cscli metrics](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_metrics)
  * [Manage decisions](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_decisions_list)
  * [Dashboard setup](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_dashboard)
  * Evaluate blocklist impact before full deployment

---

## Reduce Resource Consumption

**What this solves:** Eliminate automated noise, 404 probes, and malicious traffic to reduce server load and log volumes.

### Implementation Options

* Use any of the edge blocking methods described above
* [Enable monitoring dashboards](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_dashboard) to measure impact
* Track metrics with [cscli metrics](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_metrics) to quantify resource savings

---

## Multi-Tenant Protection

**What this solves:** Apply different security policies per customer, application, or environment without policy conflicts.

### Implementation Approaches

* **Custom Lists per Tenant**
  * [Configure centralized allowlists](/docs/next/local_api/centralized_allowlists)
  * [Filter decisions by origin or scenario](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_decisions_delete)
  * Use separate integration URLs for different tenant policies

* **Environment Isolation**
  * [Manage contexts with cscli](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_contexts)
  * [Configure collections per environment](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_collections)
  * Separate AppSec rule sets by tenant requirements

---

## SIEM/SOAR Integration

**What this solves:** Enrich existing security tools with CrowdSec's threat intelligence and IOC streams.

### IOC Management

* **Import Custom IOCs**
  * [Import decisions from CSV/JSON](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_decisions_import)
  * Support for ban, captcha, and throttle actions
  * Tag with custom origins for tracking

* **Alert Enrichment**
  * [Use CTI helpers in notification templates](/docs/next/notification_plugins/template_helpers)
  * Automatically enrich alerts with threat intelligence
  * [Configure notification plugins](/docs/next/notification_plugins/intro)

* **MISP Integration** (Coming Soon)
  * Bidirectional IOC exchange with MISP platforms
  * Automated threat intelligence sharing

---

## Web Application Protection

**What this solves:** Quickly protect applications from OWASP Top-10 attacks and vulnerability probing.

### AppSec Deployment

* **Reverse Proxy WAF**
  * [Complete WAF setup guide](/u/user_guides/waf_rp_howto)
  * [AppSec configuration guide](/docs/next/appsec/configuration)
  * [Virtual patching with AppSec rules](/docs/next/appsec/configuration)

* **Quick Deployment**
  * Install Security Engine on your reverse proxy
  * Enable AppSec collections for common attack patterns
  * Configure bouncer for real-time blocking

---

## Bot and Scraper Management

**What this solves:** Control aggressive crawlers and scraping tools while preserving legitimate user access.

### Management Strategies

* **Rate Limiting**
  * [Import throttle decisions](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_decisions_import)
  * Use `throttle` action type for rate limiting
  * Configure graduated responses (throttle â†’ ban)

* **Blocking Approaches**
  * Edge blocking via firewall or WAF integration
  * Behavioral detection with custom scenarios
  * IP reputation-based filtering

---

## Legacy Application Protection

**What this solves:** Add modern security controls to applications that cannot be modified directly.

### Protection Strategies

* **Transparent Proxy Protection**
  * [Deploy WAF at reverse proxy level](/u/user_guides/waf_rp_howto)
  * [Configure virtual patching rules](/docs/next/appsec/configuration)
  * Block exploits without application changes

* **Custom Rule Development**
  * Adapt AppSec rules for legacy application patterns
  * Create custom scenarios for specific vulnerabilities
  * Test thoroughly to avoid breaking application functionality

---

## Custom Behavior Protection

**What this solves:** Create targeted protections for specific abuse patterns like spam, credential stuffing, or scalping attacks.

### Custom Detection Development

* **Scenario Customization**
  * [Manage scenarios with cscli](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_scenarios_install)
  * [Create custom scenarios](/docs/next/scenarios/create)
  * [Test scenarios with explain mode](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_explain)

* **AppSec Rule Development**
  * [Configure custom AppSec rules](/docs/next/appsec/configuration)
  * Create pattern-matching rules for specific behaviors
  * Test rules in simulation mode before deployment

---

## Alert Enhancement and Triage

**What this solves:** Accelerate incident response with contextual threat intelligence and automated routing.

### Enhancement Options

* **Notification Enrichment**
  * [Configure notification plugins](/docs/next/notification_plugins/intro)
  * [Use CTI helpers in templates](/docs/next/notification_plugins/template_helpers)
  * Send enriched alerts to Slack, email, or SIEM

* **Operational Dashboards**
  * [Set up monitoring dashboards](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_dashboard)
  * [Track metrics with cscli](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_metrics)
  * Provide SOC teams with actionable context

---

## Threat Hunting and Intelligence

**What this solves:** Enable proactive threat hunting with global intelligence correlation and local threat mirroring.

### Hunting Capabilities

* **Console Integration**
  * [Enroll in CrowdSec Console](/docs/next/cscli/cscli_console_enroll)
  * Access global CTI and CVE correlation data
  * Use web interface for threat investigation

* **Intelligence Integration**
