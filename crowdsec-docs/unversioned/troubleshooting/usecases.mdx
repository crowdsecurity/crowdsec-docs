## Block Known-Bad IPs at the Edge

Pull up-to-date IP lists from CrowdSec **Blocklist as a Service** endpoints into your edge protection.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you want direct integration into your firewalls.
Good option if you are not using a Security Engine and want your CDN or WAF to benefit from CrowdSec's blocklists.

**How it works:**
- Create a blocklist integration in your console account.
- Select blocklists you want to be served by this endpoints.
- Use the endpoint's URL and credentials to retrieve the merged and up-to-date list.

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're experiencing high server load from automated traffic or want to reduce infrastructure costs.
Good option if you need to optimize server performance and reduce log storage requirements.

**How it works:**
- Use CrowdSec blocklists to preemptively block crowd validated noise.
- Go further by deploying CrowdSec Security Engine to detect malicious patterns in your traffic.

## Multi-Tenant Protection

Apply different security policies per customer, application, or environment without policy conflicts using flexible context management.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're managing multiple customers, applications, or environments with different security requirements.
Good option if you need granular policy control and want to avoid cross-tenant security policy interference.

**How it works:**
- Configure separate contexts for each tenant using cscli context management.
- Set up centralized allowlists with tenant-specific filtering rules.
- Create distinct integration endpoints for different tenant policies.
- Deploy separate AppSec rule sets tailored to each tenant's requirements.

## SIEM/SOAR Integration

Enrich existing security tools with CrowdSec's real-time threat intelligence and IOC streams from 70,000+ global contributors.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're using SIEM/SOAR tools and want to enhance them with fresh, crowd-sourced threat intelligence.
Good option if you need automated IOC management and want to reduce false positives in security alerts.

**How it works:**
- Import custom IOCs from your existing tools using CSV/JSON format.
- Configure notification plugins to automatically enrich alerts with contextual threat data.
- Use CTI helpers in templates to add global intelligence context to security events.
- Set up bidirectional data exchange with platforms like MISP for comprehensive threat sharing.

## Web Application Protection

Quickly protect web applications from OWASP Top-10 attacks and zero-day vulnerability probing with behavior-driven detection.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you need immediate protection for web applications against common attack patterns.
Good option if you want virtual patching capabilities and real-time threat blocking without modifying application code.

**How it works:**
- Deploy CrowdSec Security Engine with AppSec module on your reverse proxy or web server.
- Enable pre-built AppSec collections targeting OWASP Top-10 attack patterns.
- Configure bouncers for real-time blocking of detected threats.
- Implement virtual patching rules to protect against specific vulnerabilities.

## Bot and Scraper Management

Control aggressive crawlers and scraping tools while preserving legitimate user access using graduated response strategies.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're dealing with aggressive bots or scrapers that impact your site performance.
Good option if you need granular control over automated traffic without blocking legitimate users or search engines.

**How it works:**
- Configure behavioral detection scenarios to identify suspicious crawling patterns.
- Implement graduated responses starting with throttling, escalating to temporary bans.
- Use specialized AI Crawlers Blocklist to block known malicious crawling IPs.
- Deploy edge blocking through firewall or CDN integration for immediate protection.

## Legacy Application Protection

Add modern security controls to legacy applications that cannot be modified directly using transparent proxy protection.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're running legacy applications that lack built-in security features.
Good option if you need immediate protection without the risk of modifying critical legacy code.

**How it works:**
- Deploy CrowdSec WAF at the reverse proxy level in front of your legacy application.
- Configure virtual patching rules to block known exploits targeting your application stack.
- Create custom AppSec rules adapted to your legacy application's specific patterns.
- Test protection rules in simulation mode before enabling blocking to ensure application functionality.

## Custom Behavior Protection

Create targeted protections for specific abuse patterns like spam, credential stuffing, or scalping attacks using custom detection rules.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're facing unique attack patterns not covered by standard security solutions.
Good option if you need highly specific protection tailored to your application's business logic and user patterns.

**How it works:**
- Analyze your specific abuse patterns to understand attacker behavior.
- Create custom scenarios using CrowdSec's scenario framework for behavioral detection.
- Develop AppSec rules for pattern-matching specific malicious requests.
- Test custom rules thoroughly using explain mode and simulation before production deployment.
