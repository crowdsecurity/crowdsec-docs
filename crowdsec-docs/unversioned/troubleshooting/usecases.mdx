## Block Known-Bad IPs at the Edge

Pull up-to-date IP lists from CrowdSec **Blocklist as a Service** endpoints into your edge protection.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you want direct integration into your firewalls.
Good option if you are not using a Security Engine and want your CDN or WAF to benefit from CrowdSec's blocklists.

**How it works:**
- Create a blocklist integration in your console account.
- Select blocklists you want to be served by this endpoints.
- Use the endpoint's URL and credentials to retrieve the merged and up-to-date list.

## Reduce Noise to save Resources address alert fatigue 

Eliminate automated noise from unwanted probes, spam and malicious traffic to reduce server load and log volumes by up to 80%.

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're experiencing high server load from automated traffic or want to reduce infrastructure costs.
Good option if you need to optimize server performance and reduce log storage requirements.

**How it works:**
- Use CrowdSec blocklists to preemptively block crowd validated noise.
- Go further by deploying CrowdSec Security Engine to detect malicious patterns in your traffic.
- Use an AppSec enabled Remediation Component to use CrowdSec WAF.
- Track quantified savings through metrics and performance monitoring.

## Multi-Tenant Protection

Apply different security policies per customer, application, tier, [...] retrieving contextualized IP Lists.

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're managing multiple customers, applications, or environments with different security requirements.
Good option if you need granular policy control and want to avoid cross-tenant security policy interference.

**How it works:**
- Configure separate blocklist integrations for each context.
- Assign context-specific blocklist AND allowlists.
- Go further by creating custom lists based on detections made on your infrastructure.

## Bot and Scraper Management

Control aggressive crawlers and scraping tools while preserving legitimate user access using graduated response strategies.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're dealing with aggressive bots or scrapers that impact your site performance.
Good option if you want to prevent illegitimate AI crawlers from visiting your site.

**How it works:**
- Retrieve AI Crawlers and/or Botnets IPs from CrowdSec Blocklist integrations
- Block at the edge using your firewall or CDN.

## Block Common web attacks fast

Quickly protect web applications from the latest CVEs and generic vulnerability exploits using CrowdSec WAF.

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you want a modern OpenSource WAF solution.  
Benefit from CrowdSec's Virtual patching catalog while being able to use your existing ModSecurity rules as is.

**How it works:**
- Deploy CrowdSec Security Engine with AppSec module on your reverse proxy or web server.
- Get CrowdSec Virtual patching collection.
- Easily scale and identify behaviors accross multiple servers over time.
- Go further by using your existing appsec rules.
- Even test CRS rules out of band on your production traffic to easily adapt them to you needs.

## Legacy Application Protection

Add modern security controls to legacy applications that cannot be modified directly using transparent proxy protection.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're running legacy applications that lack built-in security features.
Good option if you need immediate protection without the risk of modifying critical legacy code.

**How it works:**
- Deploy CrowdSec WAF at the reverse proxy level in front of your legacy application.
- Configure virtual patching rules to block known exploits targeting your application stack.
- Create custom AppSec rules adapted to your legacy application's specific patterns.
- Test protection rules in simulation mode before enabling blocking to ensure application functionality.

## Custom Behavior Protection

Create targeted protections for specific abuse patterns like spam, credential stuffing, or scalping attacks using custom detection rules.  

**Is it for me?**
Ideal if you're facing unique attack patterns not covered by standard security solutions.
Good option if you need highly specific protection tailored to your application's business logic and user patterns.

**How it works:**
- Analyze your specific abuse patterns to understand attacker behavior.
- Create custom scenarios using CrowdSec's scenario framework for behavioral detection.
- Develop AppSec rules for pattern-matching specific malicious requests.
- Test custom rules thoroughly using explain mode and simulation before production deployment.
