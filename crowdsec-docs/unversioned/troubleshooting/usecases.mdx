## Block Known-Bad IPs at the Edge

Pull up-to-date IP lists from CrowdSec **Blocklist as a Service** endpoints into your edge protection.  

**Is it for me?**  

Ideal if you want direct integration into your firewalls.
Good option if you are not using a Security Engine and want your CDN or WAF to benefit from CrowdSec's blocklists.

**How it works:**
- Create a blocklist integration in your console account.
- Select blocklists you want to be served by this endpoints.
- Use the endpoint's URL and credentials to retrieve the merged and up-to-date list.

## Legacy Application Protection

Add modern security controls to legacy applications that cannot be modified directly using transparent proxy protection.  

**Is it for me?**  

Ideal if you're running legacy applications that lack built-in security features.
Good option if you need immediate protection without the risk of modifying critical legacy code.

**How it works:**
- Deploy CrowdSec WAF at the reverse proxy level in front of your legacy application.
- Configure virtual patching rules to block known exploits targeting your application stack.
- Additionally create custom AppSec rules adapted to your legacy application's specific patterns.
- Test protection rules out of band (simulation mode) before enabling blocking to ensure application functionality.

## Custom Behavior Protection

Create targeted protections for specific abuse patterns like **spam**, **credential stuffing**, or **scalping attacks**, [...] using custom detection rules or scenarios.  

**Is it for me?**  

Ideal if you're facing unique attack patterns not covered by standard security solutions.
Good option if you need highly specific protection tailored to your application's business logic and user patterns.

**How it works:**
- Analyze your specific abuse patterns to understand attacker behavior.
- Create custom scenarios using CrowdSec's scenario framework for behavioral detection.
- Eventually develop AppSec rules for pattern-matching specific malicious requests.
- Test custom rules thoroughly using explain mode and simulation before production deployment.
