title: Console Health Check Issues
id: console_issues
---

The CrowdSec Console monitors the health of your CrowdSec stack *(Security Engines, Log Processors, remediation components and blocklist integrations)* and raises alerts when issues are detected.  
This page lists all possible health check issues, their trigger conditions, and links to detailed troubleshooting guides.

## Understanding Issue Criticality

- 🔥 **Critical**: Immediate attention required - core functionality is impaired
- ⚠️ **High**: Important issue that should be addressed soon - may impact protection effectiveness
- 💡 **Recommended**: Additional actions that improve your security posture *(coming in future Stack Health iterations)*
- 🌟 **Bonus**: Optimization advice and upper-tier recommendations with strong return on value *(coming in future Stack Health iterations)*

## Issue Dependencies

Some issues are related and share common root causes:

- **Engine No Alerts** may be caused by:
  - LP No Logs Read
  - LP No Logs Parsed
  - Scenarios not installed or in simulation mode

- **LP No Alerts** may be caused by:
  - LP No Logs Read
  - LP No Logs Parsed
  - Scenarios not matching the parsed events

Understanding these dependencies helps you troubleshoot faster by addressing root causes first.

## Future Enhancements

For planned and experimental health checks, see [Future Console Health Check Issues](/u/troubleshooting/future_console_issues) for features including:

- Enhanced configuration validation
- Blocklists optimization recommendations
- Collection update notifications
- False positive prevention checks
- Premium feature recommendation based on detected benefit
