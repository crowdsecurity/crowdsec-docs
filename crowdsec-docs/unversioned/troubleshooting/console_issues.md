title: Console Health Check Issues
id: console_issues
---

The CrowdSec Console monitors the health of your CrowdSec stack *(Security Engines, Log Processors, remediation components and blocklist integrations)* and raises alerts when issues are detected.  
This page lists all possible health check issues, their trigger conditions, and links to detailed troubleshooting guides.

## Understanding Issue Criticality

- 🔥 **Critical**: Immediate attention required - core functionality is impaired
- ⚠️ **High**: Important issue that should be addressed soon - may impact protection effectiveness
- 💡 **Recomended**: Additionnal actions that will continue improving your security posture *(comming in next iterations of Stack Health)*
- 🌟 **Bonus** : Optimization advises and upper tier recommendation with great return on value *(comming in next iterations of Stack Health)*

## Issue Dependencies

Some issues are related and share common root causes:

- **Engine No Alerts** may be caused by:
  - LP No Logs Read
  - LP No Logs Parsed
  - Scenarios not installed or in simulation mode

- **LP No Alerts** may be caused by:
  - LP No Logs Read
  - LP No Logs Parsed
  - Scenarios not matching the parsed events

Understanding these dependencies helps you troubleshoot more efficiently by addressing root causes first.

## Future Enhancements
