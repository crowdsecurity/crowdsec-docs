Now that your CrowdSec installation is up and running, here are some post-installation steps to help you continue your journey.  
Some steps are **recommended** <span class="sideBarItemRecommended"><a href="#"></a></span> for most users, while others are **optional** <span class="sideBarItemOptional"><a href="#"></a></span> and offer additional customization or advanced capabilities.  

To make sure your installation is properly setup run a [ü©∫ Health Check](/getting_started/health_check.mdx) if you haven't already done so.  
For general errors whilst installing you can follow our [üö® troubleshooting guide](/getting_started/post_installation/troubleshoot.mdx).

### 1. CrowdSec Console ‚≠ê

### 3. Acquisitions üõ†Ô∏è

Acquisitions are sources of logs that CrowdSec can analyze.
