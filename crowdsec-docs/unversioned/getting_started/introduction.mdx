## What is CrowdSec Security Engine?

The Security Engine is a collaborative and lightweight <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="An Intrusion Detection System monitors logs or traffic to detect and report suspicious or malicious behavior, such as scans, brute-force attempts, or exploits.">Intrusion Detection System</UnderlineTooltip> (IDS) and <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A security system that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application to prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and more.">Web Application Firewall</UnderlineTooltip> (WAF).

It begins by reading logs specified in <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Acquisition files tell CrowdSec where to find logs and which application they belong to.">acquisitions</UnderlineTooltip>, then uses <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="YAML files that extract relevant data from logs, such as IP addresses, timestamps, or request paths.">parsers</UnderlineTooltip> to structure the information. This data is evaluated against <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Behavioral rules written in a domain-specific language that define what malicious activity looks like, such as multiple failed logins in a short time.">scenarios</UnderlineTooltip>, which are designed to detect specific types of attacks or suspicious patterns.

When an attack is identified, CrowdSec can apply a <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A temporary or permanent decision, like blocking an IP address, taken in response to a detected threat.">remediation</UnderlineTooltip>, based on rules defined in <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Profiles are rule sets that define which decisions to take (or ignore) when a behavior is detected.">profiles</UnderlineTooltip>.

What makes CrowdSec unique is its <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Users who detect malicious behavior share anonymized signals with the wider network, helping others preemptively block emerging threats.">collaborative threat intelligence</UnderlineTooltip> system, where each protected system contributes to a [community blocklist](/docs/next/central_api/community_blocklist) that helps everyone stay better protected.

## What is a Remediation Component?

Remediation Components are software packages that connect to the <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="The Local API (LAPI) is exposed by the Security Engine and acts as the interface for retrieving and managing decisions.">Local API</UnderlineTooltip> (LAPI) and enforce <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Decisions are remediation actions such as bans or alerts taken by the Security Engine in response to detected threats.">decisions</UnderlineTooltip> made by the Security Engine.

Previously referred to as *bouncers*, these components can operate independently, such as the [Firewall Remediation](bouncers/firewall.mdx), which integrates with <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A widely used packet filtering and firewall system for Linux.">iptables</UnderlineTooltip>, <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="The modern replacement for iptables, offering improved performance and a more consistent syntax.">nftables</UnderlineTooltip>, or <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="The built-in firewall system used on BSD-based systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS.">pf</UnderlineTooltip>. They can also be embedded directly into existing applications, such as [Nginx](bouncers/nginx.mdx), where <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A lightweight scripting language embedded into software like Nginx to enable custom behavior, including dynamic security enforcement.">Lua</UnderlineTooltip> is used to enforce decisions at runtime.

This is often referred to as the <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="An Intrusion Prevention System actively blocks or mitigates detected threats, often based on decisions made by an Intrusion Detection System.">Intrusion Prevention System</UnderlineTooltip> (IPS) layer that complements the <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="An Intrusion Detection System monitors logs or traffic to detect and report suspicious or malicious behavior, such as scans, brute-force attempts, or exploits.">Intrusion Detection System</UnderlineTooltip> (IDS) role of the Security Engine. They do not make decisions on their own; instead, they act based on what the Security Engine instructs.

## Prerequisites

We recommend that you understand the following prerequisites before installing CrowdSec:

### Hardware

CrowdSec is a lightweight software that can run on most modern hardware.

However, the recommendation is at least:

* platform:
    * amd64
    * arm64
    * armhf
* 1 CPU core
* 100mb of free RAM
* 1GB of free disk space

:::info
We recommend 1gb of free disk space due to the amount of data that can be stored in the database.
:::

### Operating System

We support the following operating systems:

* [Linux](/getting_started/installation/linux.mdx)
* [FreeBSD](/getting_started/installation/freebsd.mdx)
* [Windows](/getting_started/installation/windows.mdx)
* [MacOS](/getting_started/installation/macos.mdx)
* [Docker](/getting_started/installation/docker.mdx)
* [Kubernetes](/getting_started/installation/kubernetes.mdx)
* [OPNsense](/getting_started/installation/opnsense.mdx)
* [pfSense](/getting_started/installation/pfsense.mdx)
* [WHM](/getting_started/installation/whm.mdx)

[See version matrix for detailed breakdown](/docs/next/getting_started/versions_matrix)

### Ports

CrowdSec Security Engine uses the following default ports (bound to localhost/loopback by default) - these can be altered after installation:

* 6060/tcp: Prometheus metrics port
* 8080/tcp: API port
