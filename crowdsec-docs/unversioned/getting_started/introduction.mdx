## What is CrowdSec Security Engine?

The Security Engine is a lightweight, collaborative <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="An Intrusion Detection System monitors logs or traffic to detect and report suspicious or malicious behavior, such as scans, brute-force attempts, or exploits.">Intrusion Detection System</UnderlineTooltip> (IDS) with optional <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A security system that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application to prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and more.">Web Application Firewall</UnderlineTooltip> (WAF) capabilities. It detects behaviors that match known attack patterns defined by scenarios.

At a high level, the engine works like this:

1. It reads logs from sources you define in <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Acquisition files tell CrowdSec where to find logs and which application they belong to.">acquisitions</UnderlineTooltip>.
2. It normalizes them with <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="YAML files that extract relevant data from logs, such as IP addresses, timestamps, or request paths.">parsers</UnderlineTooltip>.
3. It evaluates behavior against <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Behavioral rules written in a domain-specific language that define what malicious activity looks like, such as multiple failed logins in a short time.">scenarios</UnderlineTooltip>.
4. It creates <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A temporary or permanent decision, like blocking an IP address, taken in response to a detected threat.">decisions</UnderlineTooltip> based on <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Profiles are rule sets that define which decisions to take (or ignore) when a behavior is detected.">profiles</UnderlineTooltip>, which remediation components enforce.

What makes CrowdSec unique is its <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Users who detect malicious behavior share anonymized signals with the wider network, helping others preemptively block emerging threats.">collaborative threat intelligence</UnderlineTooltip>: when you opt in, your detections help maintain a [community blocklist](/docs/next/central_api/community_blocklist) that protects everyone.

## What is a Remediation Component?

Remediation Components (previously called *bouncers*) enforce the Security Engine's decisions by connecting to the <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="The Local API (LAPI) is exposed by the Security Engine and acts as the interface for retrieving and managing decisions.">Local API</UnderlineTooltip> (LAPI).

They can be standalone (for example, [Firewall Remediation](bouncers/firewall.mdx) with <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A widely used packet filtering and firewall system for Linux.">iptables</UnderlineTooltip>, <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="The modern replacement for iptables, offering improved performance and a more consistent syntax.">nftables</UnderlineTooltip>, or <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="The built-in firewall system used on BSD-based systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS.">pf</UnderlineTooltip>) or embedded inside applications like [Nginx](bouncers/nginx.mdx), where <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="A lightweight scripting language embedded into software like Nginx to enable custom behavior, including dynamic security enforcement.">Lua</UnderlineTooltip> enforces decisions in real time.

Think of this as the <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="An Intrusion Prevention System actively blocks or mitigates detected threats, often based on decisions made by an Intrusion Detection System.">Intrusion Prevention System</UnderlineTooltip> (IPS) layer that complements the Security Engine's IDS role. The Remediation Component does not decide; it simply enforces what the Security Engine decides.

## Prerequisites

If you are new to CrowdSec, read this page once, then jump to your platform install guide.
We recommend understanding the following prerequisites before you install:

### Hardware

CrowdSec is lightweight and runs on most modern hardware. Recommended minimums:

* platform:
    * amd64
    * arm64
    * armhf
* 1 CPU core
* 100 MB of free RAM
* 1 GB of free disk space

:::info
We recommend 1 GB of free disk space due to the amount of data that can be stored in the database.
:::

### Operating System

We support the following operating systems:

* [Linux](/getting_started/installation/linux.mdx)
* [FreeBSD](/getting_started/installation/freebsd.mdx)
* [Windows](/getting_started/installation/windows.mdx)
* [MacOS](/getting_started/installation/macos.mdx)
* [Docker](/getting_started/installation/docker.mdx)
* [Kubernetes](/getting_started/installation/kubernetes.mdx)
* [OPNsense](/getting_started/installation/opnsense.mdx)
* [pfSense](/getting_started/installation/pfsense.mdx)
* [WHM](/getting_started/installation/whm.mdx)

### Ports

CrowdSec Security Engine uses the following default ports (bound to localhost/loopback by default). You can change them after installation:

* 6060/tcp: Prometheus metrics port
* 8080/tcp: API port

## Next Steps

After installing CrowdSec, use our **[interactive Health-Check guide](health_check.mdx)** to verify your setup. It will walk you through detection, connectivity, and remediation so you can confirm the stack is working end to end.
