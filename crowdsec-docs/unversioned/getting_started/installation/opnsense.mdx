# OPNsense plugin

The CrowdSec plugin for OPNsense is installed from the official repositories.
It includes a Log Processor, LAPI service, and Remediation Component. This allows you
to:

 - block attacking traffic from entering the network (protect machines that don't have CrowdSec)
 - deploy a log processor on OPNsense and scan its logs for attacks
 - use the OPNsense server as LAPI for other log processors and remediation components
 - list the hub plugins (parsers, scenarios..) and decisions on the OPNsense admin interface

## Plugin installation

Click `System > Firmware > Plugins` menu. Select os-crowdsec. It will deploy three packages:

 - `os-crowdsec`, the plugin itself
 - `crowdsec`
 - `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer`

Do not enable/start the services from the terminal like you would on a standard freebsd system, because the plugin takes care of that.

Refresh the page and go to `Services > CrowdSec > Overview` to verify the running services and installed configurations.

Great, you now have CrowdSec installed on your system. Have a look at the [post installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.md) to see how to to configure and optimize it,
or keep reading [the rest of the plugin documentation](/getting_started/install_opnsense.md)
