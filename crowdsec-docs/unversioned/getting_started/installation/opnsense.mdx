# Install on OPNsense

New to CrowdSec? Start with the [introduction](/unversioned/getting_started/introduction.mdx) to understand the components and prerequisites.

The CrowdSec plugin for OPNsense is installed from the official repositories.
It includes a log processor, LAPI service, and Remediation Component. This allows you to:
to:

 - block attacking traffic before it reaches the network (protect machines without CrowdSec)
 - scan OPNsense logs for attacks
 - use OPNsense as the LAPI for other agents and remediation components
 - view hub items (parsers, scenarios) and decisions in the OPNsense UI

## Plugin installation

Go to `System > Firmware > Plugins`, select `os-crowdsec`, and install it. It will deploy three packages:

 - `os-crowdsec`, the plugin itself
 - `crowdsec`
 - `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer`

Do not enable or start services from the terminal like a standard FreeBSD system; the plugin manages them for you.

Refresh the page and go to `Services > CrowdSec > Overview` to verify the running services and installed configurations.

## Next steps

Great, you now have CrowdSec installed. Review the [post-installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.mdx) to finish setup, or continue with [the rest of the plugin documentation](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec_opnsense).
