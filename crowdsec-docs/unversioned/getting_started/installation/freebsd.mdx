# Install on FreeBSD

New to CrowdSec? Start with the [introduction](/unversioned/getting_started/introduction.mdx) to understand the components and prerequisites.

# Configure repositories

FreeBSD packages are available in the official repositories.

By default, `pkg install` uses quarterly releases (January, April, July, October), which include security fixes.

You can check `/etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf` and [change **quarterly** to **latest**](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/QuarterlyBranch) if you feel comfortable upgrading your system.

## Install the Security Engine

The CrowdSec package itself can be installed with:

```shell
sudo pkg install crowdsec
```

You'll see a message that tells you how to activate the service:

#### Enable Service

```shell
sudo sysrc crowdsec_enable="YES"
```

```bash title="Command Output"
crowdsec_enable:  -> YES
```

#### Start Service

```shell
sudo service crowdsec start
```

```bash title="Command Output"
Fetching hub inventory
INFO[21-12-2021 03:13:35 PM] Wrote new 197364 bytes index to /usr/local/etc/crowdsec/hub/.index.json 
[...]
```

## Install a Remediation Component

:::warning
The Security Engine only detects. To block malicious traffic, install a [Remediation Component](/bouncers/intro.md).
:::

For a quick start, we install the [PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_(firewall)) firewall [Remediation Component](/bouncers/intro.md). This may not fit every environment, so see the [Remediation documentation](/bouncers/intro.md) for alternatives.

To install:

```shell
sudo pkg install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
```

Then you must enable it with the following commands:

#### Enable Service

```shell
sudo sysrc crowdsec_firewall_enable="YES"
```

```bash title="Command Output"
crowdsec_firewall_enable:  -> YES
```

#### Start Service

```shell
sudo service crowdsec_firewall start
```

```bash title="Command Output"
Registered: cs-firewall-bouncer-ZjpcXlUx
```

## Next steps

Great, you now have CrowdSec installed. Continue with the [post-installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.mdx) to finish setup and optimize your deployment.
