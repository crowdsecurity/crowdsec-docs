# pfSense package

Before getting started, it is advised to read the [introduction](/unversioned/getting_started/introduction.mdx) page to understand the prerequisites and concepts for running CrowdSec.

The CrowdSec package for pfSense is not installed from the official repositories, at least not yet.

Please refer to the [detailed documentation](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec_pfsense) to install or update it from a release archive.
