# Install on Windows

New to CrowdSec? Start with the [introduction](/unversioned/getting_started/introduction.mdx) to learn the core concepts and prerequisites.

## Install the Security Engine

### MSI Installer

We provide MSI installers for Windows. Download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/releases/latest).

Download and run the installer. It installs CrowdSec as a Windows service and starts it automatically.

### Chocolatey

You can install CrowdSec using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a package manager for Windows.

```bash
choco install crowdsec
```

## Install a Remediation Component

:::warning
The Security Engine only detects. To block malicious traffic, install a [Remediation Component](/bouncers/intro.md) to enforce decisions.
:::

:::info
The Windows Firewall [Remediation Component](/bouncers/intro.md) requires the **.NET 6 runtime**. Install it before running the component, or use our setup bundle to install both.

The runtime can be downloaded from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime).
Choose the "Console App" download.
:::

### MSI Installer

You can download either an MSI (component only) or a setup bundle (component + .NET 6 runtime) from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-windows-firewall-bouncer/releases).


### Chocolatey

You can install the component using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a package manager for Windows.

```bash
choco install crowdsec-windows-firewall-bouncer
```

## Next steps

Great, you now have CrowdSec installed. Visit the [post-installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.mdx) to finish setup and optimize your deployment. For IIS or Windows Firewall specifics, see the [detailed documentation](/docs/next/getting_started/install_windows).
