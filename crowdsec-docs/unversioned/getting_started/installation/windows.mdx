# Installation Windows

## Install Security Engine 

### MSI Installer

We provide MSI installers for Windows. You can download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/releases/latest)

Download and run the installer, it will install CrowdSec as a service and start it.

### Chocolatey

You can install CrowdSec using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a package manager for Windows.

```bash
choco install crowdsec
```

## Install Remediation Component

:::warning
Security Engine by itself is a detection engine, it will not block anything. You need to install a [Remediation Component](/bouncers/intro.md) to enforce decisions
:::

:::info
The Windows Firewall [Remediation Component](/bouncers/intro.md) requires the **.NET 6 runtime**. Install it before running the Component or use our setup bundle to install it with the Component.

The runtime can be downloaded from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime).
Choose the "Console App" download.
