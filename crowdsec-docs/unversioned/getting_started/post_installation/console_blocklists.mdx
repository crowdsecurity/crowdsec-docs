# CrowdSec Blocklists

In the community edition of CrowdSec, you can subscribe to three blocklists for proactive protection against known malicious sources.
These lists are curated and updated regularly by the CrowdSec team.

## Subscribing to your first blocklist

To subscribe to a blocklist, you need to go to the `Blocklists` tab in the console.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Blocklists"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_blocklists_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_blocklists_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

### Which blocklist should I use?

This depends on the traffic you want to block and the level of strictness you need.

For instance, if you're running a web server and wish to shield your websites from known free proxies, subscribing to the `Free Proxies list` blocklist would be a suitable measure.

:::info
A `proxy` is an intermediary server. It hides the original requester IP address from your server.
:::

On the other hand, if you're not hosting websites, for example, you might opt for the `Firehol greensnow.co list`. This list compiles IPs known for conducting `bruteforce` attacks on a range of services, providing a targeted defense against such malicious activities.

:::info
`Bruteforce` attacks are trial-and-error attempts to obtain credentials such as passwords.
:::

If neither example fits, each blocklist includes a description to help you choose.

### Subscribing an engine to a blocklist

To subscribe an engine to a blocklist, click `Subscribe` next to the blocklist.

This opens the details panel. Click `Add Security Engine(s)` to choose engines.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Blocklist Subscription"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_blocklist_subscribe_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_blocklist_subscribe_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

In the modal, select the engine(s) and the action to apply, then click `Save`.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Blocklist Engine Selection"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_blocklist_engine_selection_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_blocklist_engine_selection_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

After saving, it can take up to `2 hours` for the blocklist to become active because community blocklists refresh every 2 hours.

### Where can I see blocklist decisions?

To see the active blocklists within an engine, you can run the following command:

<FormattedTabs
    bash="cscli metrics show decisions"
    powershell="cscli.exe metrics show decisions"
    k8s="kubectl exec -n crowdsec -it crowdsec-lapi-<id> -- cscli metrics show decisions"
/>

```bash title="Command Output"
Local API Decisions:

│ crowdsecurity/http-bad-user-agent          │ CAPI     │ ban     │ 11623 │
│ crowdsecurity/http-bad-user-agent          │ crowdsec │ ban     │ 1     │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────┴─────────┴───────╯
```

In the example output, you can see that the `free_proxies` and `tor-exit-nodes` blocklists are active and have the origin `lists`.

## Next steps

Now that you have subscribed an engine to a list, continue exploring the Console:
