# CrowdSec Hub

The [CrowdSec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) serves as a repository where individuals can access an array of premade configuration files.

These resources are developed by both the CrowdSec team and the broader community, offering a ready-to-use collection for integrating into your own configurations.

## Hub Tour

The [Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) is divided into many sections, each of which is designed to help you find the right configuration for your needs.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Hub"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_hub_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_hub_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

### Collections Tab

[Collections](/docs/next/collections/intro) refers to a set of configurations intended to operate in unison. For instance, the [crowdsecurity/sshd collection](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/sshd) includes settings aimed at overseeing attacks towards a SSH server.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec sshd collection"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

You can see the contents of the [collection](/docs/next/collections/intro) by viewing the `Content` section.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec sshd collection content"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_content_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_content_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

As illustrated above, the `sshd` collection encompasses a [parser](/docs/next/parsers/intro) along with [scenarios](/docs/next/scenarios/intro) focused on `brute force` attacks.

### Configurations Tab

The configurations tab holds individual files that can be used with your CrowdSec setup. Each item will include tags to help you identify the intended use case.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec configurations"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_configurations_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_configurations_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

For example [apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228) is a `Attack scenario` that is designed to detect attacks related to the Apache Log4j2 CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_log4j_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_log4j_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Another example is [crowdsecurity/nginx-logs](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/nginx-logs) which is a `Log parser` that is designed to parse `Nginx` logs.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec nginx-logs"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_nginx_logs_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_nginx_logs_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::info
There are more configuration types other than `Attack scenario` and `Log parser`. However, these are the most common types.

### Bouncers Tab

:::info
The term `Bouncers` has been updated to `Remediation Components` in the [Taxonomy](https://www.crowdsec.net/blog/updating-crowdsec-naming-taxonomy).

However, legacy items might still use the term `bouncers` just know that they are the same thing.
:::

This tab contains [Remediation Components](/bouncers/intro.md) that can be used to enforce decisions made by CrowdSec [Security Engine](/docs/next/getting_started/security_engine_intro).

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec bouncers"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_bouncers_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_bouncers_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

For example, [crowdsecurity/iptables](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/remediation-components/iptables) is a `Remediation Component` that can be used to block IP addresses using `iptables`.

### AppSec Configurations Tab

:::info
From version `1.6.0` CrowdSec introduced the [AppSec Component](/docs/next/appsec/intro) which allows you to turn CrowdSec into a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
:::

[AppSec configurations](/docs/next/appsec/configuration) are designed to configure the [AppSec Component](/docs/next/appsec/intro), it provides sensible defaults for various web applications.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec AppSec configurations"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_appsec_config_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_appsec_config_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

### AppSec Rules Tab

[AppSec Rules](/docs/next/appsec/rules_syntax) are designed to be used with the [AppSec Component](/docs/next/appsec/intro) to detect and block attacks against web applications.

These rules are defined and loaded by [AppSec Configurations](/docs/next/appsec/configuration).

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec AppSec rules"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_appsec_rules_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_appsec_rules_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

## Next Steps?

Now that you have viewed the CrowdSec Hub, you can head back to the [post installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.md#1-crowdsec-console) to follow the rest of the steps.
