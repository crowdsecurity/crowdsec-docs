# Troubleshoot

import UnixWindowsK8sTabs from '../../../src/components/UnixWindowsK8sTabs';

This troubleshoot section is intended to help you resolve common issues that may arise during the installation process. You can find extensive [troubleshooting documentation](/troubleshooting/intro.md) if this document does not resolve your issues.

# Logs and Errors

Before starting to troubleshoot the installation processes we need to find the underlying error that happened. The logs are the best place to start looking for errors.

The log location alter depending on your platform here are the default locations:

- **Linux** `/var/log/crowdsec.log`
- **Freebsd** `/var/log/crowdsec.log`
  - **Opnsense** `/var/log/crowdsec/crowdsec.log`
  - **Pfsense** `/var/log/crowdsec/crowdsec.log`
- **Windows** `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log`
- **Kubernetes** `kubectl logs -n crowdsec crowdsec-(agent|lapi)-*`

## Filter logs for error messages

By default CrowdSec can be quite verbose, to filter the logs for error messages you can use the following commands:

<UnixWindowsK8sTabs
    bash='sudo grep -E "level=(error|fatal)" /var/log/crowdsec.log'
    cmd='findstr "level=error level=fatal" C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log'
    powershell='Select-String "level=(error|fatal)" C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log'
    k8s='kubectl logs -n crowdsec crowdsec-agent-* | grep -E "level=(error|fatal)"'
/>

:::info
Please update the above commands to match your log location if it is different.

## Common errors and solutions

### Port Conflict

```bash title="Error Message"
level=fatal msg="while serving local API: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: bind: address already in use"
```

By default as outlined in the [prerequisites](/unversioned/getting_started/prerequisites.md) page, CrowdSec uses ports `6060` and `8080`. If you have another service using these ports you will need to alter CrowdSec configuration to use different ports.

This can be achieved by modifying two configuration files here are the locations of the files:

- **Linux**
  - `/etc/crowdsec/config.yaml`
  - `/etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml`
- **Freebsd**, **Opnsense**, **Pfsense**
  - `/usr/local/etc/crowdsec/config.yaml`
  - `/usr/local/etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml`
- **Windows**
  - `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\config\config.yaml`
  - `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\config\local_api_credentials.yaml`

You can then use your favourite text editor to modify the files, here is an example of how to change the ports:

:::info
These configuration files are owned by the default admin user and you will need to use `sudo` or `Administrator` permissions to modify them.
:::

```yaml title="config.yaml"
api:
 server:
   listen_uri: 127.0.0.1:8080 # CHANGE this line to the port you wish to listen on
```

```yaml title="local_api_credentials.yaml"
url: http://127.0.0.1:8080 # CHANGE this line to the same port as you configured above
login: ...
password: ...
```

After you have made the changes you will need to restart the CrowdSec service.

<UnixWindowsK8sTabs
    bash="sudo systemctl restart crowdsec"
    powershell="Restart-Service crowdsec"
    k8s="kubectl delete pod -n crowdsec crowdsec-agent-*"
/>

## Next Steps?

If the above hasn't resolved the issue you are facing, you can find more detailed troubleshooting documentation [here](/troubleshooting/intro.md).

If you have resolved the issue you can continue with the [post installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.md#1-crowdsec-console).
