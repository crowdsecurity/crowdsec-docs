# Profiles

Profiles are a list of rules that drives what actions will be taken by CrowdSec upon a detection. This can be as trivial as banning an IP address, or as complex as computing previous detections and banning on a scaling factor.

The `profiles.yaml` file, situated at the root of the configuration directory, outlines profiles to be used. It is loaded during startup and can be refreshed while the system is running.

Here is the default file path fo profiles depending on your platform:

- **Linux** `/etc/crowdsec/profiles.yaml`
- **Freebsd** `/usr/local/etc/crowdsec/profiles.yaml`
- **Windows** `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\config\profiles.yaml`
- **Kubernetes** By default, in `/etc/crowdsec/profiles.yaml` in `crowdsec-lapi-*` pod. You can overwrite it in `values.yaml -> config.profiles.yaml`

```yaml title="Default profiles.yaml"
name: default_ip_remediation
#debug: true
filters:
 - Alert.Remediation == true && Alert.GetScope() == "Ip"
decisions:
 - type: ban
   duration: 4h
#duration_expr: Sprintf('%dh', (GetDecisionsCount(Alert.GetValue()) + 1) * 4)
# notifications:
#   - slack_default  # Set the webhook in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/slack.yaml before enabling this.
#   - splunk_default # Set the splunk url and token in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/splunk.yaml before enabling this.
#   - http_default   # Set the required http parameters in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/http.yaml before enabling this.
#   - email_default  # Set the required email parameters in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/email.yaml before enabling this.
on_success: break
```

We won't delve into the file's specifics in this section, but further information is available in the [profiles.yaml reference](/docs/next/profiles/format#profile-directives).

## Example Modifications

Here are a few examples of how you might modify your profiles to better suit your needs.

### Enable Notifications

:::info
Notifications are plugins that can forward alerts to another service for example the `http` plugin can forward to your SIEM
::: 

This adjustment can be made by configuring the plugin files located under:

- **Linux** `/etc/crowdsec/notifications/`
- **Freebsd** `/usr/local/etc/crowdsec/notifications/`
- **Windows** `C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\config\notifications\`

We wont be covering the configuration as you can find [extensive documentation](/docs/next/notification_plugins/intro) on the files. Once this is done you can start by removing the comment (`#`) from the [`notifications`](/docs/next/profiles/format#notifications) lines. This will enable notifications for the specified components.

```yaml
name: default_ip_remediation
#debug: true
filters:
 - Alert.Remediation == true && Alert.GetScope() == "Ip"
decisions:
 - type: ban
   duration: 4h
#duration_expr: Sprintf('%dh', (GetDecisionsCount(Alert.GetValue()) + 1) * 4)
#highlight-next-line
notifications:
#highlight-next-line
  - slack_default
on_success: break
```

</details>



### Scaling Decision Duration

```yaml
duration_expr: Sprintf('%dh', (GetDecisionsCount(Alert.GetValue()) + 1) * 4)
```

This adjustment can be made by removing the comment (`#`) from the [`duration_expr`](/docs/next/profiles/format#duration_expr) line. The default formula utilizes [`GetDecisionsCount`](/docs/next/expr/other_helpers#getdecisionscountvalue-string-int) to determine how many times the specific value has been identified. We always add 1 to the count to ensure that the first ban is always 4 hours.

The resulting duration is calculated by multiplying this count by 4, then the [`Sprintf`](/docs/next/expr/strings_helpers/#sprintfformat-string-a-interface-string) function formats the result into a string with the `h` suffix. The `h` suffix is used to denote hours within [Go's time package](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration).

So for example if an IP has been banned 3 times, the resulting string would be `12h` meaning 12 hours.

#   - email_default  # Set the required email parameters in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/email.yaml before enabling this.
on_success: break
```

### Captcha Decision

:::info
You **MUST** have configured a remediation component that supports [Captcha Challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA), see [here](/u/bouncers/intro).
:::

Upon detecting an incident, instead of immediately imposing a ban, you could opt to challenge the individual with a [Captcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA). This approach can be implemented by inserting an extra profile prior to the ban profile.

```yaml
name: captcha_remediation
filters:
  - Alert.Remediation == true && Alert.GetScope() == "Ip" && Alert.GetScenario() contains "http"
## Any scenario with http in its name will trigger a captcha challenge
decisions:
 - type: captcha
   duration: 4h
on_success: break
#highlight-next-line
---
name: default_ip_remediation
...
```

The highlighted line above is the seperator between the two profiles. It is important to note that the `on_success` directive is set to `break` to ensure that the alert will not be evaluated by other profiles, so the offender will only get a captcha decision.

 - Alert.Remediation == true && Alert.GetScope() == "Ip"
decisions:
 - type: ban
   duration: 4h
#duration_expr: Sprintf('%dh', (GetDecisionsCount(Alert.GetValue()) + 1) * 4)
# notifications:
#   - slack_default  # Set the webhook in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/slack.yaml before enabling this.
#   - splunk_default # Set the splunk url and token in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/splunk.yaml before enabling this.
#   - http_default   # Set the required http parameters in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/http.yaml before enabling this.
#   - email_default  # Set the required email parameters in /etc/crowdsec/notifications/email.yaml before enabling this.
on_success: break
```

## Next Steps?

Now that you have made some modifications to your profiles, you **MUST** restart the CrowdSec service to apply the changes. You can do this by running the following command:

<UnixWindowsK8sTabs
  bash="sudo crowdsec -t && sudo systemctl restart crowdsec"
  powershell="Restart-Service crowdsec"
  k8s="helm upgrade --install crowdsec crowdsecurity/crowdsec --namespace crowdsec -f values.yaml"
/>
