# Troubleshoting Acquisition

In this section we will walk you through how to troubleshoot acquisitions that are not working as expected.

Depending on the acquisition type you are using, you may need to check different things.

## File based acquisitions

### Check the log file is found and readable

The first thing to check is that the log file is found and readable by the CrowdSec service.

Within the CrowdSec log file it will log if the file was found or not.

Log file locations change by distribution, you can find the default log location [outlined here](/troubleshooting/security_engine.mdx#where-are-the-logs-stored).

<UnixWindowsK8sTabs
  bash="grep '/path/to/your/file.log' /var/log/crowdsec.log"
  powershell='Select-String "/path/to/your/file.log" C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\log\crowdsec.log'
  k8s="kubectl logs -n crowdsec crowdsec-agent-* | grep '/path/to/your/file.log'"
/>

:::info
Please update the above commands to match your log location if it is different and which file you are looking for.
:::

```bash title="File is found"
time="2024-04-16T11:47:55Z" level=info msg="Adding file /path/to/your/file.log to datasources" type=file
```

```bash title="File is not found"
time="2024-04-16T11:54:26Z" level=warning msg="No matching files for pattern /path/to/your/file.log" type=file
```

:::warning
The above log message will log the pattern that is set on the source if you are using a globbing pattern. So you may want to alter the filter to match the parent folder for example: `grep '/path/to/your/' /var/log/crowdsec.log`
:::

### Log file is found but not read

If the log file is found but not read, you may want to check the permissions on the file.

This should be highly unlikely as the CrowdSec service runs as root and should be able to read any file. However, if you are running inside a container environment you may need to check the permissions on the file.

If you are not running inside a container enviromnet you may be facing issues with the default setting on file based acquisitons which is to use `inotify` to watch the file. You can disable this by setting `poll_without_inotify` to `true` in the acquisition configuration.

```bash title="Example acquisition"
filenames:
  - /path/to/your/file.log
poll_without_inotify: true
labels:
  type: your_type
```
