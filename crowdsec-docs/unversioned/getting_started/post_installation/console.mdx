# CrowdSec Console

The CrowdSec Console serves as a web-based interface designed for managing your CrowdSec Security Engines effectively. This console comes equipped with an intuitive dashboard, offering a comprehensive visualization of your engines' activities, thereby enhancing the ease of monitoring and analysis.

Additionally, it offers the capability to integrate enhanced functionalities, including the option to incorporate Third-Party blocklists. This feature not only extends the flexibility and adaptability of your security setup but also enables a more robust defense mechanism by leveraging external intelligence sources. 

## Your first Enrollment

This guide presumes you have already installed CrowdSec on your machine. If you haven't, you can check the following getting started guides:

### Survey

When you log in for the first time, we will ask you a few questions to gain a clearer understanding of your needs and use case.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Survey"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_signup_survey_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_signup_survey_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::info
The survey is optional and you can skip it if you want. We use this information to tailor your experience and to better understand our users.
:::

### Engines page

After signing up, the first page you'll visit is the engines page. This is where you can view all your enrolled engines and check their current status.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Enrollment Key"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_mainpage_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_mainpage_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

However! since this is your first enrollment, you won't see any engines yet. Let's fix that by enrolling a new engine.

At the very bottom of the page, you will see a code card with a command to run on your engine. This command will enroll it to your account.

:::info
`$ENROLLMENT_KEY` is a placeholder for your actual enrollment key.
:::

<FormattedTabs
    bash="sudo cscli console enroll $ENROLLMENT_KEY"
    powershell="cscli.exe console enroll $ENROLLMENT_KEY"
    yaml={`# In your values.yml file
lapi:
  env:
    # To enroll the Security Engine to the console
    - name: ENROLL_KEY
      value: '{enroll-key}'
    - name: ENROLL_INSTANCE_NAME
      value: 'my-k8s-cluster'
    - name: ENROLL_TAGS
      value: 'k8s linux test'`}
/>

```bash title="Command Output"
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] manual set to true
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Enabled manual : Forward manual decisions to the console
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Enabled tainted : Forward alerts from tainted scenarios to the console
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Watcher successfully enrolled. Visit https://app.crowdsec.net to accept it.
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Please restart crowdsec after accepting the enrollment.
```


### Accept Enrollment

Once you execute the command, a new engine will show up on the engines page. Select this new engine and click on "Accept enroll" to proceed.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Accept Enrollment"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_enroll_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_enroll_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::tip
If you don't see the engine appear, you can use the refresh button at the right of the page near "Add Security Engine".
:::

### Restart CrowdSec

After accepting the enrollment, you will need to restart the CrowdSec service.

<FormattedTabs
    bash="sudo systemctl restart crowdsec"
    powershell="Restart-Service crowdsec"
    k8s="kubectl delete pod -n crowdsec crowdsec-lapi-*"
/>

:::warning
While it's not critical to restart the service right away, it's advisable to do so at your earliest convenience to make sure all `metadata` is fully synchronized.
:::

## Next Steps?

Now that you have enrolled your first engine, you can start exploring the console and its features. Here are a few things you can do next:

- [Third-Party Blocklists](/getting_started/post_installation/console_blocklists.mdx)
- [CrowdSec Hub](/getting_started/post_installation/console_hub.mdx)

If not head back to the [post installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.md#1-crowdsec-console) to follow the rest of the steps.
