# CrowdSec Console

The CrowdSec Console is a web interface for managing your CrowdSec Security Engines. It provides dashboards and activity views to make monitoring and analysis easier.

The Console also lets you add advanced features, including third-party blocklists, so you can extend protection with external intelligence.

## Your first enrollment

This guide assumes CrowdSec is already installed. If not, start with one of these guides:

- [Install on Linux](/getting_started/installation/linux.mdx)
- [Install on FreeBSD](/getting_started/installation/freebsd.mdx)
- [Install on Windows](/getting_started/installation/windows.mdx)
- [Install on MacOS](/getting_started/installation/macos.mdx)
- [Install on Kubernetes](/getting_started/installation/kubernetes.mdx)

### Sign Up

Head over to the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup) and sign up for a new account.

        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_login_light.png"),
            dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_login_dark.png"),
        }}
    />

:::info
If more than 5 minutes have passed, [contact us](mailto:support@crowdsec.net).

### Survey

When you log in for the first time, we ask a few questions to understand your use case.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Survey"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_signup_survey_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_signup_survey_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::info
The survey is optional. We use the information to tailor your experience and better understand users.
:::

### Engines page

After signing up, the first page you see is the engines page, where you can view enrolled engines and their status.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Enrollment Key"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_mainpage_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_mainpage_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Since this is your first enrollment, you will not see any engines yet. Let's enroll one.

At the bottom of the page, you will see a code card with a command to run on your engine. This enrolls it to your account.

:::info
`$ENROLLMENT_KEY` is a placeholder for your actual enrollment key.
:::

<FormattedTabs
    bash="sudo cscli console enroll $ENROLLMENT_KEY"
    powershell="cscli.exe console enroll $ENROLLMENT_KEY"
    yaml={`# In your values.yml file
lapi:
  env:
    # To enroll the Security Engine to the console
    - name: ENROLL_KEY
      value: '{enroll-key}'
    - name: ENROLL_INSTANCE_NAME
      value: 'my-k8s-cluster'
    - name: ENROLL_TAGS
      value: 'k8s linux test'`}
/>

```bash title="Command Output"
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] manual set to true
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Enabled manual : Forward manual decisions to the console
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Enabled tainted : Forward alerts from tainted scenarios to the console
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Watcher successfully enrolled. Visit https://app.crowdsec.net to accept it.
INFO[2024-02-21T16:50:17Z] Please restart crowdsec after accepting the enrollment.
```


### Accept enrollment

Once you execute the command, a new engine appears on the engines page. Select it and click "Accept enroll."

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec Accept Enrollment"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_enroll_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_enroll_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::tip
If you do not see the engine, use the refresh button near "Add Security Engine".
:::

### Restart CrowdSec

After accepting the enrollment, restart the CrowdSec service.

<FormattedTabs
    bash="sudo systemctl restart crowdsec"
    powershell="Restart-Service crowdsec"
    k8s="kubectl delete pod -n crowdsec crowdsec-lapi-*"
/>

:::warning
Restarting is not critical immediately, but it ensures metadata is fully synchronized.
:::

## Next steps

Now that your first engine is enrolled, explore the Console features:

- [Third-Party Blocklists](/getting_started/post_installation/console_blocklists.mdx)
- [CrowdSec Hub](/getting_started/post_installation/console_hub.mdx)

If you want to follow the full setup, return to the [post-installation steps](/getting_started/next_steps.mdx#1-crowdsec-console-).
