### Metrics definitions

- `raw`: Raw metrics are the metrics that are directly collected from the crowdsec engine.
- `computed`: Computed metrics are the metrics that are derived from the raw metrics (we compute them based on the raw metrics).

#### Raw metrics

- `dropped`: The traffic that was discarded by your remediation components (bouncers) and Blocklists. Its represent the data received from differents remediation components, so it can be :
    - `requests` : the number of requests that were dropped.
    - `bytes` : the number of bytes that were dropped.
    - `packets` : the number of packets that were dropped.
- `processed`: The traffic that was processed by by your remediation components (bouncers) and Blocklists. Its represent the data received from differents remediation components, so it can be :
    - `requests` : the number of requests that were processed.
    - `bytes` : the number of bytes that were processed.
    - `packets` : the number of packets that were processed.

#### Computed metrics

The computed metrics are estimations based on the raw metrics. They are calculated by appliying a coefficient to remediation components (bouncers) metrics that approximates the saved resources.
The coefficient is calculated based on the remediation components (bouncers) configuration and the raw metrics.

:::note
As most bouncers operate below the application layer, a single blocked attempt prevents the attacker from follow-up attacks.
We can convert the raw metrics into estimates more representative of the difference in traffic and attack volume compared to when Crowdsec is not running.

Your infrastructure's exact true usage may vary, but the computed metrics are a good approximation of the resources saved by using Crowdsec.

[Understand how we compute data](https://www.crowdsec.net/blog/value-of-preemptive-blocking)

- `saved`:
    - `log_lines`: The number of log lines that were saved. It's the number of log lines that would have been generated if the traffic was not dropped.
    - `storage`: The amount of storage that was saved. It's the amount of storage that would have been used by your logs if the traffic were not dropped.
    - `egress_traffic`: The amount of egress traffic that was saved. It's is the amount of egress traffic that would have been spent to serve responses if the requests were not dropped.
- `dropped`: The traffic that was dropped by your remediation components (bouncers) and Blocklists. 
- `prevented`: The attacks that were prevented by your remediation components (bouncers) and Blocklists.
