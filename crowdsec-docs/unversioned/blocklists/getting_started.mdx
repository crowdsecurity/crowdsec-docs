There are two ways to get started with Blocklists:

1. **Security Engine** - Use the CrowdSec Security Engine to ingest blocklists
2. **Integrations** - Use Integrations to ingest blocklists into firewall, CDN, or other security solutions

Depending on which path you take you can start with the following guides:

If you're new to CrowdSec, and want to use blocklists we recommend starting with the [Integrations guide](integrations/intro.md), however, if you are unsure where to start, feel free to browse our [main website for more information](https://www.crowdsec.net/).
