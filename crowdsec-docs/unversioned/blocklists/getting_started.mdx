title: How to use CrowdSec Blocklists
---

import ConsolePromo from '@site/src/components/ConsolePromo.js';

There are two main paths to integrate CrowdSec blocklists into your infrastructure:

1. **Security Engine** - If you already have a CrowdSec Security Engine, you can use it to ingest blocklists
2. **Integrations** - For a purely SaaS approach, use Integrations to ingest blocklists into firewall, CDN, (...) via our Blockist as a Service Integrations endpoints

Depending on which path you take you can start with the following guides:

# Security Engine Ingestion
If you already have security engines and remediation components installed in your infrastructure, you can follow the guide bellow.   
<!-- We'll make those sections a bit more unifor later, maybe even in this current page rather than remote ones made only for this purpose -->

# SaaS Integration
If you want to use blocklists without installing the CrowdSec Security Engine you can follow the guide bellow.

If you're new to CrowdSec, and want to use blocklists we recommend starting with the [Integrations guide](integrations/intro.mdx), however, if you are unsure where to start, feel free to browse our [main website for more information](https://www.crowdsec.net/).
