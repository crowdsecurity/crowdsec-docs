### Pre-requisites

If you already have installed and enrolled your Security Engine you can skip this section.

Before using blocklists with Security Engines, we recommend following these guides:

Security Engine Quick Start:
- [Linux](getting_started/installation/linux.mdx)
- [FreeBSD](getting_started/installation/freebsd.mdx)
- [Windows](getting_started/installation/windows.mdx)
- [Docker](getting_started/installation/docker.mdx)
- [Kubernetes](getting_started/installation/kubernetes.mdx)
- [WHM](getting_started/installation/whm.mdx)

Install Remediation Component:
- [Unix Firewall](bouncers/firewall.mdx)
- [Nginx](bouncer/nginx.mdx)
- [HAProxy](bouncers/haproxy.mdx)
- [Cloudflare Workers](bouncers/cloudflare-workers.mdx)

The above is just a limited selection of the available Remediation Components. To see the complete list, including Third Party options, visit the [Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/remediation-components).

After installing a Security Engine, ensure you enroll it to the [Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/). If you need assistance with this process, you can follow [this guide](getting_started/post_installation/console.mdx).

### Blocklists

Once you have completed the above steps, you can start using blocklists with your Security Engine. To do this, you will need to:

- Find a blocklist on the [Catalog](console/blocklists/catalog.md) you wish to use.
- Use the [Subscription Section](console/blocklists/subscription.md##security-engines) to tie the blocklist to your Security Engine.
