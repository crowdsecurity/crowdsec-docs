## Overview
This bouncer allows you to protect your Node.js application from IPs that have been detected by CrowdSec. Depending on the decision taken by CrowdSec, user will either get denied (403) or have to fill a captcha (401).

It supports ban and captcha remediation, and all decisions with Ip or Range scope.

## Requirements

-   `Node.js >= 20`

## Installation

```bash
npm install @crowdsec/nodejs-bouncer
```

## Features 

- CrowdSec Local API support

    - Handle `ip` and `range` scoped decisions
    - `Live mode` or `Stream mode`

- Support IpV4 and Ipv6 (Ipv6 range decisions are yet only supported in `Live mode`)

## Usage

When a user is suspected by CrowdSec to be malevolent, the bouncer would either display a captcha to resolve or
simply a page notifying that access is denied. If the user is considered as a clean user, the page will be accessible
as normal.

A ban wall could look like:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/nodejs/screenshots/ban-wall.png')} alt="Ban wall" title="Ban wall" />

A captcha wall could look like:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/nodejs/screenshots/captcha-wall.png')} alt="Captcha wall" title="Captcha wall" />

With the provided bouncer, it is possible to customize all the colors of these pages so that they integrate
best with your design.

On the other hand, all texts are also fully customizable. This will allow you, for example, to present translated pages
in your users' language.
