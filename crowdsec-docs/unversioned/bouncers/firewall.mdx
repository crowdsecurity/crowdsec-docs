CrowdSec Remediation Component written in golang for firewalls.

crowdsec-firewall-bouncer will fetch new and old decisions from a CrowdSec API and add them to a blocklist used by supported firewalls.

Supported firewalls:
 - iptables (IPv4 :heavy_check_mark: / IPv6 :heavy_check_mark: )
 - nftables (IPv4 :heavy_check_mark: / IPv6 :heavy_check_mark: )
 - ipset only (IPv4 :heavy_check_mark: / IPv6 :heavy_check_mark: )
 - pf (IPV4 :heavy_check_mark: / IPV6 :heavy_check_mark: )

See as well [Manual Installation documentation below](#manual-installation)

## Configuration

There are two primary ways to use the firewall bouncer:
 - **managed** (default): cs-firewall-bouncer will create ipset/nft sets, insert the associated firewall rules and manage the set contents
 - **set only**: you already have a (complex) firewall setup, cs-firewall-bouncer will only manage the _content_ of existing specified sets

### Managed mode : Iptables/ipset or Nftables

__This is the default behaviour__

In "managed" mode (mode `nftables` or `iptables`), component creates all the needed elements (rules, sets) and insert the appropriate rules in nftables or iptables.

:::warning

IPSet (when using `iptables` mode) does not support a timeout greater than 2147483 seconds (about 596 hours). If crowdsec is configured to take decisions longer than that, the bouncer will cap the duration to 2147482 seconds.

:::

### Set Only : Iptables/Ipset table

In iptables set-only mode (mode `ipset`), the component only handles the **contents** of sets that are specified by `blacklists_ipv4` and `blacklists_ipv6`.
These sets must be created before starting the component, and it is the user's responsibility to create the associated iptables rules.

:::warning
IPSet does not support a timeout greater than 2147483 seconds (about 596 hours). If crowdsec is configured to take decisions longer than that, the bouncer will cap the duration to 2147482 seconds.
:::

### Set Only : nftables

In nftables set only mode (mode `nftables` with `nftables.{ipv4,ipv6}.set-only` set to `true`), the component only manages the **contents** of the sets.
It's the user's responsibility to create the associated chains and sets :

```yaml title="/tmp/bouncer.nft"
table ip crowdsec {
	set crowdsec-blacklists {
		type ipv4_addr
		flags timeout
	}

	chain crowdsec-chain {
		type filter hook input priority filter; policy accept;
		ip saddr @crowdsec-blacklists drop
	}
}
table ip6 crowdsec6 {
	set crowdsec6-blacklists {
		type ipv6_addr
		flags timeout
	}

	chain crowdsec6-chain {
		type filter hook input priority filter; policy accept;
		ip6 saddr @crowdsec6-blacklists drop
	}
}
```


## Metrics

You can check the metrics generated by the firewall-bouncer using the command `cscli metrics show bouncers`.

![firewall-bouncer-metrics](/img/firewall-bouncer-metrics.png)

Each line in the output represents a different source of blocked IPs, along with detailed metrics.

- `Origin` refers to the name of the source, which could be:
  - `CAPI` - The community blocklist that you receive in exchange for the information you provide to the network
  - `crowdsec (security engine)` - The decisions made by your Security Engine based on triggered scenarios
  - `lists:*` - Various lists to which you are subscribed
- `active_decisions IPs` represents the number of IPs contained in the respective list
- `dropped bytes & packets` indicates the number of bytes and packets dropped by the firewall due to the actions of the specified origin
- `processed bytes & packets` is only present for the `Total` line, as it denotes the overall number of bytes and packets processed by your firewall.


As the firewall bouncer operates at the network level, most malicious programs will not progress beyond attempting to establish a connection (and being denied). Therefore, metrics cannot reflect the "potentially saved traffic."

### Ipset only mode

If you are running ipset only mode, crowdsec-firewall-bouncer tries parsing the output to produce metrics, but:
 - "managed" firewalls such ufw might confuse parser and lead to inconsistent metrics.
 - "total" counters amount since the machine start, or `iptables -Z` is ran. Running `iptables -Z` when using `ipset` only mode might help keep consistent metrics.

## Configuration Reference

## Manual installation

### Assisted

First, download the latest [`crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` release](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-firewall-bouncer/releases).

```bash
$ tar xzvf crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.tgz
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

### From source

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-firewall-bouncer.git
cd cs-firewall-bouncer/
make release
tar xzvf crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.tgz
cd crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-v*/
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Upgrade

If you already have `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` installed, please download the [latest release](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-firewall-bouncer/releases) and run the following commands:

```bash
tar xzvf crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.tgz
cd crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-v*/
sudo ./upgrade.sh
```


### Configuration for manual installation

To be functional, the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` service must be able to authenticate with the local API.
The `install.sh` script will take care of it (it will call `cscli bouncers add` on your behalf).
If it was not the case, the default configuration is in `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml`.


You can then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
```

If you need to make changes to the configuration file and be sure they will never be modified or reverted
by package upgrades, starting from v0.0.25 you can write them in a `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml.local` file as described in
[Overriding values](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/configuration/crowdsec_configuration#overriding-values).
Package upgrades may have good reasons to modify the configuration, so be careful if you use a `.local` file.


### logs

logs can be found in `/var/log/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.log`

### modes

 - mode `nftables` relies on github.com/google/nftables to create table, chain and set.
 - mode `iptables` relies on `iptables` and `ipset` commands to insert `match-set` directives and maintain associated ipsets
 - mode `ipset` relies on `ipset` and only manage contents of the sets (they need to exist at startup and will be flushed rather than created)
 - mode `pf` relies on `pfctl` command to alter the tables. You are required to create the following tables on your `pf.conf` configuration:

```bash
 # create crowdsec ipv4 table
table <crowdsec-blacklists> persist

# create crowdsec ipv6 table
table <crowdsec6-blacklists> persist
```

 You can refer to the step-by-step instructions of the [user tutorial on
 FreeBSD](/blog/crowdsec_firewall_freebsd)
 to setup crowdsec-firewall-bouncer with pf.

 ### ipset

 ipset lists have to exist before crowdsec-firewall-bouncer starts.
 You can create them and add them to your iptables like this:

```console
ipset create crowdsec-blacklists hash:ip timeout 0 maxelem 150000
ipset create crowdsec6-blacklists hash:ip timeout 0 family inet6 maxelem 150000
iptables -I INPUT 1 -m set --match-set crowdsec-blacklists src -j DROP
ip6tables -I INPUT 1 -m set --match-set crowdsec6-blacklists src -j DROP
```
