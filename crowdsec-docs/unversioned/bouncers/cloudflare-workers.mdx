:::warning
This Bouncer heavily relies on Cloudflare Workers and KV store. It works best on a paid Workers subscription.
More explanation in the chapter [Test with Cloudflare free plan](#appendix--test-with-cloudflare-free-plan)
:::

:::warning
After configuring and starting the Bouncer, please see the [setting up worker fail mode](#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode) section.  
:::

This Bouncer deploys Cloudflare Worker in front of a Cloudflare Zone/Website, which checks if incoming request's IP address/Country/AS is present in a KV store and takes necessary remedial actions. It also periodically updates the KV store with CrowdSec LAPI's decisions.

## Installation

### Using packages

Packages for crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer [are available on our repositories](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec#intall-our-repositories). You need to pick the package accord to your firewall system :

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' ,},
    { label: 'RHEL/Centos/Fedora', value: 'rhel', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
sudo yum install crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Then run the following commands to setup your bouncer:


```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN1>,<CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN2> -o /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # auto-generate cloudflare config for provided space separated tokens 
sudo vi /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # review config and set `crowdsec.lapi_key` if haven't alread
sudo systemctl start crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer # the bouncer now syncs the crowdsec decisions with cloudflare components.
```

:::warning

Please configure your server to emit real IPs rather than cloudflare IPs in logs, so crowdsec can function properly. See how to [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170786-Restoring-original-visitor-IPs)

:::

:::info

If your bouncer is not installed on the same machine than LAPI, don't forget to set the `crowdsec_lapi_url` and `crowdsec.lapi_key` in the configuration file `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml`

:::

:::note

You need to run `sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -d` to cleanup exisiting cloudflare components created by bouncer before editing the config files.

:::

:::note

You can run `sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN1>,<CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN2> -o /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml` to generate the configuration by discovering all the accounts and the zones associated with the provided tokens.

:::

### Manual Installation

#### Assisted

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-cloudflare-worker-bouncer/releases).

```bash
tar xzvf crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.tgz
cd crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer/
sudo ./install.sh
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN1>,<CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN2> -o /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # auto-generate cloudflare config for provided tokens 
sudo vi /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # review config and set `crowdsec.lapi_key` if haven't already
sudo systemctl start crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer # the bouncer now syncs the crowdsec decisions with cloudflare components.
```

#### From source

:warning: requires go >= 1.20

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
cd cs-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
make release
cd cd crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer-*
./crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN1>,<CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN2> -o /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # auto-generate cloudflare config for provided space separated tokens
sudo vi /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # review config and set `crowdsec.lapi_key` if haven't already
sudo systemctl start crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```


## How it works

![Architecture](/img/bouncer/cloudflare-worker/cfworkerarch.png)

The bouncer does the following:

1. Create a Cloudflare Worker and a Worker KV per configured account.
2. Create a Worker Route(s) per configured zone. Any request matching the route would be handled by the worker.
3. For every matching incoming request, the worker checks whether it's IP, Country and AS have a decision against. It checks for this in it's KV store. If found it performs the corresponding remediation.
4. The bouncer also periodically updates the KV store with the latest decisions from CrowdSec.

## Cloudflare Configuration

**Background:** In Cloudflare, each user can have access to multiple accounts. Each account can own/access multiple zones. In this context a zone can be considered as a domain. Each domain registered with cloudflare gets a distinct `zone_id`.


For obtaining the `token`:

1. Sign in as a user who has access to the desired account.

Then click [this link](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens?permissionGroupKeys=%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22account_settings%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22challenge_widgets%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22user_details%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_kv_storage%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_routes%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_scripts%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22zone%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%5D&name=) and create the token. 

Alternatively, you can

Go to [Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) and create the token. 

The bouncer requires the follwing permissions to function.

![image](/img/bouncer/cloudflare-worker/cloudflare_token_permissions.png)

To automatically generate config, check the helper section below.

## Helpers

The binary has built in helper scripts to do various operations.

### Auto config generator

Generates config by discovering all the accounts and the zones associated with provided list of tokens. 

Example Usage:

```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <TOKEN_1>,<TOKEN_2>...  -o cfg.yaml
cat cfg.yaml  > /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml
```

:::note
This script only generates cloudflare related config. By default it refers to the config at `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml` for crowdsec configuration. 
:::

Using custom config:
```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -c ./cfg.yaml -g <TOKEN_1>,<TOKEN_2>... 
```

### Cloudflare Cleanup

This deletes all the Cloudflare infrastructure which was created by the bouncer.

Example Usage:
```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -d 
```

## Setting up the worker route fail mode

The Bouncer creates worker routes to make the workers act as a reverse proxy for your origin servers. The worker routes are created with the failover mode set to `Fail Closed`. There's no public Cloudflare API we can use to change/update it to `Fail Open` mode.

With `Fail Closed` mode, Routes in fail closed mode will display a Cloudflare 1027 error page to visitors if there's an error within the worker. This error could be triggered due to quotas exceeding your plan etc. Cloudflare doesn't mention all the possible scenarios which could trigger this error page. 

Thus **we recommend you to manually override the failover mode to `Fail Open`** for all the worker routes created by our Bouncer. With `Fail Open` mode the requests would bypass the worker and be served directly from your origin servers. Thus your website would continue to function even if there's an error within the worker.

This can be done by following the steps below:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
2. For all the websites configured with the Bouncer, do the following:
3. Click on the website's name to open the Website's Overview page.
4. Click on the Worker Routes tab from the left menu.

![Worker Route](/img/bouncer/cloudflare-worker/cfsitedashboard.png)

5. Click on the route created by the Bouncer.
6. Click on the Edit button.
7. Click on the Request limit failure mode. Check the Fail open button.

## Appendix: Test with Cloudflare free plan
Because of some hard limits/quotas in the free plan, this bouncer is the most efficient on the paid Cloudflare plan.
But you can use it on the free plan none the less.
In this section we'll explore:
  - What the Cloudflare freeplan limitations are and The consequences of those limitations on the capabilities of the bouncer
  - An example of using this Bouncer on the free plan without issues

### Cloudflare freeplan limitations 
Our Bouncer uses Cloudflare Workers and Workers KeyValue storage
You can find their official documentation about limits there:
   - [KeyValue storage limits by plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/platform/limits/)
   - [Workers limits by plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/)

The limits to focus on for the freeplan are (in order of importance):
  - KV write 1K/day
  - Requests handled by worker: 100k/day and 1K/minute

The KV write limit of 1K per day is the main restrictive limit for our Bouncer as our decisions list (blocklist) is most of the time comprised of tens of thousands of IPs
The number of request quota is not such a massive limitation depending on the popularity of your service, but considering all the Background Noise attacks that can occur in a day, don't forget that legitimate requests are not the only thing hitting your endpoint. 

From those limitations two things happen:
  - The blocklist initial storage in KV is trucated to 1K IPs BUT will periodically receive new decisions and remove expired ones. So, eventually you'll have many more than 1K IPs in the KV but it could take a while
  - If you reach the Worker request limits, the worker will fail and the request will just passthrough until the quota is refreshed. ⚠️ You need to [properly setup the failmode](#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode)


### Use the Bouncer with Cloudflare free plan.
The main limit we can influence is the number of decisions we send to the worker.
In this section we'll configure the Bouncer to only send decisions made locally and skip the decisions from the community blocklist.

Once the you have [auto-generated the configuration](#auto-config-generator), we'll restrict the origin of decisions being sent via the config parameter [crowdsec.only_include_decisions_from](#crowdseconly_include_decisions_from)
Don't forget to [properly setup the failmode](#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode)
