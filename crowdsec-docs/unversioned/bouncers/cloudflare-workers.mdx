:::warning
This Remediation Component heavily relies on Cloudflare Workers and KV store. It works best on a paid Workers subscription.
More explanation in the chapter [Test with Cloudflare free plan](#appendix--test-with-cloudflare-free-plan)
:::

:::warning
After configuring and starting the Remediation Component, please see the [setting up worker fail mode](#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode) section.  
:::

This Remediation Component (aka Bouncer) deploys a Cloudflare Worker in front of a Cloudflare Zone/Website, which checks if incoming request's IP address/Country/AS is present in a KV store and takes necessary remedial actions. It also periodically updates the KV store with CrowdSec LAPI's decisions.

## Installation

### Using packages

Packages for crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer [are available on our repositories](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec#intall-our-repositories). You need to pick the package accord to your firewall system :

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' ,},
    { label: 'RHEL/Centos/Fedora', value: 'rhel', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
sudo yum install crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Then run the following commands to setup your Remediation Component:


```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN1>,<CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN2> -o /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # auto-generate cloudflare config for provided space separated tokens 
sudo vi /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml # review config and set `crowdsec.lapi_key` if haven't alread
sudo systemctl start crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer # the Remediation Component now syncs the crowdsec decisions with cloudflare components.
```

:::warning

Please configure your server to emit real IPs rather than cloudflare IPs in logs, so crowdsec can function properly. See how to [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170786-Restoring-original-visitor-IPs)

:::

:::info

If your Remediation Component is not installed on the same machine than LAPI, don't forget to set the `crowdsec_lapi_url` and `crowdsec.lapi_key` in the configuration file `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml`

:::

:::note

You need to run `sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -d` to cleanup exisiting cloudflare components created by Remediation Component before editing the config files.

:::

:::note

You can run `sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN1>,<CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN2> -o /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml` to generate the configuration by discovering all the accounts and the zones associated with the provided tokens.

:::

### Manual Installation

#### Assisted

sudo systemctl start crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```


## How it works

![Architecture](/img/bouncer/cloudflare-worker/cfworkerarch.png)

The Remediation Component does the following:

1. Create a Cloudflare Worker and a Worker KV per configured account.
2. Create a Worker Route(s) per configured zone. Any request matching the route would be handled by the worker.
3. For every matching incoming request, the worker checks whether it's IP, Country and AS have a decision against. It checks for this in it's KV store. If found it performs the corresponding remediation.
4. The Remediation Component also periodically updates the KV store with the latest decisions from CrowdSec.

## Cloudflare Configuration

**Background:** In Cloudflare, each user can have access to multiple accounts. Each account can own/access multiple zones. In this context a zone can be considered as a domain. Each domain registered with cloudflare gets a distinct `zone_id`.


For obtaining the `token`:

1. Sign in as a user who has access to the desired account.

Then click [this link](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens?permissionGroupKeys=%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22account_settings%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22challenge_widgets%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22user_details%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_kv_storage%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_routes%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_scripts%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22edit%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22zone%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22read%22%7D%5D&name=) and create the token. 

Alternatively, you can

Go to [Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) and create the token. 

The Remediation Component requires the follwing permissions to function.

To automatically generate config, check the helper section below.

## Helpers

The binary has built in helper scripts to do various operations.

### Auto config generator

Generates config by discovering all the accounts and the zones associated with provided list of tokens. 

Example Usage:

```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -g <TOKEN_1>,<TOKEN_2>...  -o cfg.yaml
cat cfg.yaml  > /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml
```

:::note
This script only generates cloudflare related config. By default it refers to the config at `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer.yaml` for crowdsec configuration. 
:::

Using custom config:
```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -c ./cfg.yaml -g <TOKEN_1>,<TOKEN_2>... 
```

### Cloudflare Cleanup

This deletes all the Cloudflare infrastructure which was created by the Remediation Component.

Example Usage:
```bash
sudo crowdsec-cloudflare-worker-bouncer -d 
```

## Setting up the worker route fail mode

The Remediation Component creates worker routes to make the workers act as a reverse proxy for your origin servers. The worker routes are created with the failover mode set to `Fail Closed`. There's no public Cloudflare API we can use to change/update it to `Fail Open` mode.

With `Fail Closed` mode, Routes in fail closed mode will display a Cloudflare 1027 error page to visitors if there's an error within the worker. This error could be triggered due to quotas exceeding your plan etc. Cloudflare doesn't mention all the possible scenarios which could trigger this error page. 

Thus **we recommend you to manually override the failover mode to `Fail Open`** for all the worker routes created by our Remediation Component. With `Fail Open` mode the requests would bypass the worker and be served directly from your origin servers. Thus your website would continue to function even if there's an error within the worker.

This can be done by following the steps below:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
2. For all the websites configured with the Remediation Component, do the following:
3. Click on the website's name to open the Website's Overview page.
4. Click on the Worker Routes tab from the left menu.

![Worker Route](/img/bouncer/cloudflare-worker/cfsitedashboard.png)

5. Click on the route created by the Remediation Component.
6. Click on the Edit button.
7. Click on the Request limit failure mode. Check the Fail open button.

## Appendix: Test with Cloudflare free plan
Using Cloudflare's free plan with our Remediation Component requires to understand the constraints of the CloudFlare freeplan.   
Despite these constraints, it's entirely feasible to leverage the Remediation Component for enhanced security.   

In this section we'll guide you through:
  - An overview of the Cloudflare free plan's limitations and their impact on Remediation Component functionality
  - A walkthrough for deploying the Remediation Component within these constraints successfully

### Understanding Cloudflare Free Plan Limitations
Our Remediation Component integrates with Cloudflare Workers and Workers KeyValue storage, subject to specific thresholds under the free plan.  
For the complete detailed information, refer to Cloudflare's official documentation:
   - [KeyValue storage limits by plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/platform/limits/)
   - [Workers limits by plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/)

Key limitations to note for Remediation Component operation on the free plan include:
  - KV write: Up to 1K per day
  - Worker Requests:Up to 100k per day or 1K per minute

*KV write limit of 1K per day*:   
It's the primary limiting factor as the full decisions list (blocklist) passed on to the Remediation Component often exceeds tens of thousands of IPs.   
  - It implies that the initial population of decisions in the Worker's KV will be truncated to 1K
  - However, it will still periodically receive new decisions and remove expired ones.
  - So, eventually you'll have many more than 1K IPs in the KV but it still diminishes the immediate effectiveness of the Remediation Component

The *request quota*:
While the request quota might seem ample, it's essential to remember that both legitimate traffic and potential attack patterns contribute to this total.   
  - ⚠️ It's primordial to [properly setup the failmode](#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode)
  - With the failmode set to passthrough, when you reach the Worker request limits your service will stay available, but the Remediation Component won't apply remediation anymore

### Quick Guide : Configuring the Remediation Component on Cloudflare's Free Plan
To adapt to the free plan's constraints, we can prioritize local decision-making and manual intervention over broader community-driven blocklists.   
Here's how to set it up:

1. *Configuration Setup*: Begin by [auto-generating the Remediation Component configuration](#auto-config-generator).
2. *Limiting Decision Sources*: Modify the configuration to prioritize decisions generated by your Security Engine and added manually.   
  - Using the config parameter [crowdsec.only_include_decisions_from](#crowdseconly_include_decisions_from)   
  ```yaml
crowdsec_config:
  [...]
  only_include_decisions_from: ["cscli", "crowdsec"]
  ```
3. *Failmode Configuration*: It's crucial to [configure the failmode properly](#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode) to ensure your service remains operational even when request quotas are reached.
4. *Testing with manual decisions*: Verify the functionality by adding decisions manually, which should be promptly reflected in KV storage and enforced by the Remediation Component.
  ```bash
    sudo cscli decisions add --ip 1.2.3.4 --type captcha
  ```
  check your decisions has been added using:
```bash
  sudo cscli decisions list --origin cscli
```
  And within a few seconds it will be sent to the KV and the proper remediation should be applied to the requests from the specified IP
