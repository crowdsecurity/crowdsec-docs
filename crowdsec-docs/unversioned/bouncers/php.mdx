## Overview

This Remediation Component allows you to protect your PHP application from IPs that have been detected by CrowdSec. Depending on
the decision taken by CrowdSec, user will either get denied (403) or have to fill a captcha (401).

It uses the [PHP `auto_prepend_file` mechanism](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file) and 
the [Crowdsec php remediation library](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/php-cs-bouncer) to offer remediation/IPS capability directly in your PHP application.

It supports "ban" and "captcha" remediations, and all decisions of type Ip, Range or Country (geolocation).


### Prerequisites

- This is a PHP library, so you must have a working PHP (>= 7.2.5) installation.
- Requires PHP extensions : `ext-curl`, `ext-gd`, `ext-json`, `ext-mbstring`.
- Code sources are dealt with via `composer` and `git`.
- Have CrowdSec on the same machine, or at least be able to reach LAPI.


## Installation

### Preparation

#### Install composer

Please follow [this documentation](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to install composer.

#### Install GIT

Please follow [this documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install GIT.

#### Install CrowdSec

To be able to use this component, the first step is to install [CrowdSec v1](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/getting_started/install_crowdsec/). CrowdSec is only in charge of the "detection", and won't block anything on its own. You need to deploy a bouncer to "apply" decisions.

Please note that first and foremost a CrowdSec agent must be installed on a server that is accessible by this component.

### Server and component setup

Once you set up your server as below, every browser access to a PHP script will be remediated by the standalone component.

You will have to :

- retrieve sources of the remediation in some `/path/to/the/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer` folder
- give the correct permission for the folder that contains the remediation
- copy the `scripts/settings.php.dist` file to a `scripts/settings.php` file and edit it.
- set an `auto_prepend_file` directive in your PHP setup.
- Optionally, if you want to use the standalone component in stream mode, you will have to set a cron task to refresh
  cache periodically.

#### Component sources copy

- Create a folder that will contain the project sources:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer
```

We use here `/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer` but you can choose the path that suits your needs.

- Change permission to allow composer to be run in this folder. As you should run composer with your user, this
  can be done with:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer
```

- Retrieve the last version of the component:

```bash
composer create-project crowdsec/standalone-bouncer /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer --keep-vcs
```

Note that we have to keep the vcs data as we will use it to update the component when a new version is available.

#### Files permission

The owner of the `/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer` folder should be your web-server owner (e.g. `www-data`) and the group should have the write permission on this folder.

You can achieve it by running commands like:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer
sudo chmod g+w /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer
```

#### Settings file

Please copy the `scripts/settings.php.dist` file to a `scripts/settings.php` file and fill the necessary settings in it
(see [Configurations settings](#configurations) for more details).

For a quick start, simply search for `YOUR_BOUNCER_API_KEY` in the `settings.php` file and set the API key.
To obtain a API key, you can run the `cscli bouncers add` command:

```
sudo cscli bouncers add standalone-bouncer
```

#### `auto_prepend_file` directive

We will now describe how to set an `auto_prepend_file` directive in order to call the `scripts/bounce.php` for each php access.

Adding an `auto_prepend_file` directive can be done in different ways:

###### `.ini` file

You should add this line to a `.ini` file :

    auto_prepend_file = /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/bounce.php

###### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, you should modify your Nginx configuration file by adding a `fastcgi_param` directive. The php block should look like below:

```
location ~ \.php$ {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "auto_prepend_file=/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/bounce.php";
}
```

###### Apache

If you are using Apache, you should add this line to your `.htaccess` file:

    php_value auto_prepend_file "/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/bounce.php"

or modify your `Virtual Host` accordingly:

```
<VirtualHost ...>
    ...
    ...
    php_value auto_prepend_file "/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/bounce.php"
    
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Stream mode cron task

To use the stream mode, you first have to set the `stream_mode` setting value to `true` in your `script/settings.php` file.

Then, you could edit the web server user (e.g. `www-data`) crontab:

```shell
sudo -u www-data crontab -e
```

and add the following line

```shell
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/refresh-cache.php
```

In this example, cache is refreshed every 15 minutes, but you can modify the cron expression depending on your needs.

#### Cache pruning cron task

If you use the PHP file system as cache, you should prune the cache with a cron job:

```shell
sudo -u www-data crontab -e
```

and add the following line

```shell
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/prune-cache.php
```

In this example, cache is pruned at midnight every day, but you can modify the cron expression depending on your needs.



## Upgrade

When a new release of the component is available, you may want to update sources to the last version.

### Before upgrading

**Please look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-standalone-php-bouncer/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading in order to see the list of changes that could break your application.**

To limit the risk of breaking your web application during upgrade, you can perform the following actions to disable bouncing:

- Remove the `auto_prepend_file` directive that point to the `bounce.php` file  and restart your web server
- Disable any scheduled cron task linked to remediation feature

Alternatively, but a little more risky, you could disable bouncing by editing the `scripts/settings.php` file and set the value `'bouncing_disabled'` for the `'bouncing_level'` parameter.

Once the update is done, you can reactivate the bounce. You could look at the `/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/.logs` to see if all is working as expected.

Below are the steps to take to upgrade your current component:

### Retrieve the last tag

As we kept the vcs data during installation (with the `--keep-vcs` flag), we can use git to get the last tagged sources:

```bash
cd /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer
git fetch
```

If you get an error message about "detected dubious ownership", you can run

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory /var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer
```

You should see a list of tags (`vX.Y.Z` format )that have been published after your initial installation.

### Checkout to last tag and update sources

Once you have picked up the `vX.Y.Z` tag you want to try, you could switch to it and update composer dependencies:

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z && composer update
```


## Usage

### Features

- CrowdSec Local API Support
  - Handle `ip`, `range` and `country` scoped decisions
  - `Live mode` or `Stream mode`
- Support IpV4 and Ipv6 (Ipv6 range decisions are yet only supported in `Live mode`)
- Large PHP matrix compatibility: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2
- Built-in support for the most known cache systems Redis, Memcached and PhpFiles
  - Clear, prune and refresh the cache
- Cap remediation level (ex: for sensitives websites: ban will be capped to captcha)

### Ban and captcha walls

When a user is suspected by CrowdSec to be malevolent, the component would either display a captcha to resolve or
simply a page notifying that access is denied. If the user is considered as a clean user, he/she will access the page
as normal.

By default, the ban wall is displayed as below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/standalone-php/screenshots/front-ban.jpg')} alt="Ban wall" title="Ban wall" />

By default, the captcha wall is displayed as below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/standalone-php/screenshots/front-captcha.jpg')} alt="Captcha wall" title="Captcha wall" />

Please note that it is possible to customize all the colors of these pages so that they integrate best with your design.

On the other hand, all texts are also fully customizable. This will allow you, for example, to present translated pages in your users' language.

### Configurations

Here is the list of available settings that you could define in the `scripts/settings.php` file:

#### Component behavior

- `bouncing_level`:  Select from `bouncing_disabled`, `normal_bouncing` or `flex_bouncing`. Choose if you want to apply CrowdSec directives (Normal bouncing) or be more permissive (Flex bouncing). With the `Flex mode`, it is impossible to accidentally block access to your site to people who donâ€™t deserve it. This mode makes it possible to never ban an IP but only to offer a captcha, in the worst-case scenario.


- `fallback_remediation`: Select from `bypass` (minimum remediation), `captcha` or `ban` (maximum remediation). Default to 'captcha'. Handle unknown remediations as.


- `trust_ip_forward_array`:  If you use a CDN, a reverse proxy or a load balancer, set an array of IPs. For other IPs, the remediation will not trust the X-Forwarded-For header.


- `excluded_uris`: array of URIs that will not be bounced.


- `stream_mode`: true to enable stream mode, false to enable the live mode. Default to false. By default, the `live mode` is enabled. The first time a user connects to your website, this mode means that the IP will be checked directly by the CrowdSec API. The rest of your userâ€™s browsing will be even more transparent thanks to the fully customizable cache system. But you can also activate the `stream mode`. This mode allows you to constantly feed the bouncer with the malicious IP list via a background task (CRON), making it to be even faster when checking the IP of your visitors. Besides, if your site has a lot of unique visitors at the same time, this will not influence the traffic to the API of your CrowdSec instance.

#### Local API Connection

- `auth_type`: Select from `api_key` and `tls`. Choose if you want to use an API-KEY or a TLS (pki) authentification.
  TLS authentication is only available if you use CrowdSec agent with a version superior to 1.4.0.


- `api_key`: Key generated by the cscli (CrowdSec cli) command like `cscli bouncers add standlone-php-bouncer`.
  Only required if you choose `api_key` as `auth_type`.


- `tls_cert_path`: absolute path to the component certificate (e.g. pem file).
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type`.
  **Make sure this path is not publicly accessible.** [See security note below](#security-note).


- `tls_key_path`: Absolute path to the component key (e.g. pem file).
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type`.
  **Make sure this path is not publicly accessible.** [See security note below](#security-note).


- `tls_verify_peer`: This option determines whether request handler verifies the authenticity of the peer's certificate.
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type`.
  When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.
  If `tls_verify_peer` is set to true, request handler verifies whether the certificate is authentic.
  This trust is based on a chain of digital signatures,
  rooted in certification authority (CA) certificates you supply using the `tls_ca_cert_path` setting below.


- `tls_ca_cert_path`: Absolute path to the CA used to process peer verification.
  Only required if you choose `tls` as `auth_type` and `tls_verify_peer` is set to true.
  **Make sure this path is not publicly accessible.** [See security note below](#security-note).


- `api_url`: Define the URL to your Local API server, default to `http://localhost:8080`.


- `api_timeout`: In seconds. The timeout when calling Local API. Default to 120 sec. If set to a negative value,
  timeout will be unlimited.


- `use_curl`: By default, this lib call the REST Local API using `file_get_contents` method (`allow_url_fopen` is required).
  You can set `use_curl` to `true` in order to use `cURL` request instead (`ext-curl` is in then required)

#### Cache

- `cache_system`: Select from `phpfs` (PHP file cache), `redis` or `memcached`.


- `fs_cache_path`: Will be used only if you choose PHP file cache as `cache_system`.
  **Make sure this path is not publicly accessible.** [See security note below](#security-note).


- `redis_dsn`:   Will be used only if you choose Redis cache as `cache_system`.


- `memcached_dsn`: Will be used only if you choose Memcached as `cache_system`.


- `clean_ip_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache the fact that an IP is clean. In seconds. Defaults to 5.


- `bad_ip_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache the fact that an IP is bad. In seconds. Defaults to 20.


- `captcha_cache_duration`: Set the duration we keep in cache the captcha flow variables for an IP. In seconds.
  Defaults to 86400.. In seconds. Defaults to 20.


#### Geolocation

- `geolocation`: Settings for geolocation remediation (i.e. country based remediation).

  - `geolocation[enabled]`: true to enable remediation based on country. Default to false.

  - `geolocation[type]`:  Geolocation system. Only 'maxmind' is available for the moment. Default to `maxmind`.

  - `geolocation[cache_duration]`: This setting will be used to set the lifetime (in seconds) of a cached country
    associated to an IP. The purpose is to avoid multiple call to the geolocation system (e.g. maxmind database). Default to 86400. Set 0 to disable caching.

  - `geolocation[maxmind]`: MaxMind settings.

  - `geolocation[maxmind][database_type]`: Select from `country` or `city`. Default to `country`. These are the two available MaxMind database types.

  - `geolocation[maxmind][database_path]`: Absolute path to the MaxMind database (e.g. mmdb file)
    **Make sure this path is not publicly accessible.** [See security note below](#security-note).


#### Captcha and ban wall settings


- `hide_mentions`: true to hide CrowdSec mentions on ban and captcha walls.


- `custom_css`: Custom css directives for ban and captcha walls


- `color`: Array of settings for ban and captcha walls colors.

  - `color[text][primary]`

  - `color[text][secondary]`

  - `color[text][button]`

  - `color[text][error_message]`

  - `color[background][page]`

  - `color[background][container]`

  - `color[background][button]`

  - `color[background][button_hover]`


- `text`: Array of settings for ban and captcha walls texts.

  - `text[captcha_wall][tab_title]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][title]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][subtitle]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][refresh_image_link]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][captcha_placeholder]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][send_button]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][error_message]`

  - `text[captcha_wall][footer]`

  - `text[ban_wall][tab_title]`

  - `text[ban_wall][title]`

  - `text[ban_wall][subtitle]`

  - `text[ban_wall][footer]`


#### Debug
- `debug_mode`: `true` to enable verbose debug log. Default to `false`.


- `disable_prod_log`: `true` to disable prod log. Default to `false`.


- `log_directory_path`: Absolute path to store log files.
  **Make sure this path is not publicly accessible.** [See security note below](#security-note).


- `display_errors`: true to stop the process and display errors on browser if any.


- `forced_test_ip`: Only for test or debug purpose. Default to empty. If not empty, it will be used instead of the
  real remote ip.


- `forced_test_forwarded_ip`: Only for test or debug purpose. Default to empty. If not empty, it will be used
  instead of the real forwarded ip. If set to `no_forward`, the x-forwarded-for mechanism will not be used at all.

#### Security note

Some files should not be publicly accessible because they may contain sensitive data:

- Log files
- Cache files of the File system cache
- TLS authentication files
- Geolocation database files

If you define publicly accessible folders in the settings, be sure to add rules to deny access to these files.

In the following example, we will suppose that you use a folder `crowdsec` with sub-folders `logs`, `cache`, `tls` and `geolocation`.

If you are using Nginx, you could use the following snippet to modify your website configuration file:

```nginx
server {
   ...
   ...
   ...
   # Deny all attempts to access some folders of the crowdsec standalone bouncer
   location ~ /crowdsec/(logs|cache|tls|geolocation) {
           deny all;
   }
   ...
   ...
}
```

If you are using Apache, you could add this kind of directive in a `.htaccess` file:

```htaccess
Redirectmatch 403 crowdsec/logs/
Redirectmatch 403 crowdsec/cache/
Redirectmatch 403 crowdsec/tls/
Redirectmatch 403 crowdsec/geolocation/
```

**N.B.:**
- There is no need to protect the `cache` folder if you are using Redis or Memcached cache systems.
- There is no need to protect the `logs` folder if you disable debug and prod logging.
- There is no need to protect the `tls` folder if you use API key authentication type.
- There is no need to protect the `geolocation` folder if you don't use the geolocation feature.

## Testing & Troubleshooting

### Logs

Enable `debug_mode` in the (`scripts/settings.php`) file to enable debug logging. By default, logs will be
located in the scripts path, i.e. `/var/www/crowdsec-standalone-bouncer/scripts/.logs`.

### Testing ban remediation

To test the ban remediation :
- identify or create simple php file (even a `<?php print("hello") ?>` would do)
- add a decision on your crowdsec agent (`sudo cscli decisions add -i <your ip>`)
- try to access the php file, and you should see the HTML forbidden ban page


### Testing the captcha feature

To test the captcha remediation :
- identify or create simple php file (even a `<?php print("hello") ?>` would do)
- add a decision on your crowdsec agent (`cscli decisions add -i <your ip> -t captcha`)
- try to access the php file, and you should see the captcha page



### Testing geolocation remediation

The remediation is expecting decisions with a scope of `Country`, and 2-letters code value.

To test the geolocation remediation :
- identify or create simple php file (even a `<?php print("hello") ?>` would do)
- add a decision on your crowdsec agent (`cscli decisions add --scope Country --value FR -t captcha`)
- try to access the php file, and you should see the captcha page
