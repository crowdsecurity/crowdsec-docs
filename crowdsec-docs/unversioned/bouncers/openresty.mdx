A lua Remediation Component for OpenResty.

## How does it work ?

This component leverages OpenResty lua's API, namely `access_by_lua_block` to check e IP address against the local API.

Supported features:

 - Live mode (query the local API for each request)
 - Stream mode (pull the local API for new/old decisions every X seconds)
 - Ban remediation (can ban an IP address by redirecting him or returning a custom HTML page)
 - Captcha remediation (can return a captcha)
 - Works with IPv4/IPv6
 - Support IP ranges (can apply a remediation on an IP range)

At the back, this component uses [crowdsec lua lib](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/lua-cs-bouncer/).

:::warning
If you need to upgrade the component from v0.X to v1.X, please follow [this migration process](#migrate-from-v0-to-v1) 
:::

## Installation

:::caution Before installation
openresty component depends on openresty, openresty-opm, gettext-base. it has been tested only on debian/ubuntu based distributions.
You can install openresty and openresty-opm from [openresty linux packages](https://openresty.org/en/linux-packages.html).
:::

Install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt install openresty openresty-opm gettext-base
```

### Using packages

[Setup crowdsec repositories](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec#install-our-repositories).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="openresty_debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'openresty_debian' ,},
    { label: 'RHEL/Centos/Fedora', value: 'openresty_rhel' ,},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="openresty_debian">

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-openresty-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="openresty_rhel">

```bash
sudo yum install crowdsec-openresty-bouncer
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


:::info
In stream mode, the component will launch an internal timer to pull the local API at the first request made to the server.
:::

:::caution After installation

[The openresty linux packages](https://openresty.org/en/linux-packages.html) doesn't include any `conf.d/` directory for custom configurations.
:::

You need to add `include /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/crowdsec_openresty.conf;
` in nginx config file `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` in the **http** section.

### Manual installation

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-openresty-bouncer/releases)

```bash
tar xvzf crowdsec-openresty-bouncer.tgz
cd crowdsec-openresty-bouncer-v*/
sudo ./install.sh
```

If you are on a mono-machine setup, the `crowdsec-openresty-bouncer` install script will register directly to the local crowdsec, so you're good to go !

:warning: the installation script will take care of dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu

### OpenResty Configuration

The component OpenResty configuration is located in `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/crowdsec_openresty.conf` :

```bash title="/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/crowdsec_openresty.conf"
lua_package_path '$prefix/../lualib/plugins/crowdsec/?.lua;;';
lua_shared_dict crowdsec_cache 50m;
resolver local=on ipv6=off;
lua_ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt;
init_by_lua_block {
        cs = require "crowdsec"
        local ok, err = cs.init("/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-openresty-bouncer.conf", "crowdsec-openresty-bouncer/v0.0.7")
        if ok == nil then
                ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "[Crowdsec] " .. err)
                error()
        end
        ngx.log(ngx.ALERT, "[Crowdsec] Initialisation done")
}

access_by_lua_block {
        local cs = require "crowdsec"
        cs.Allow(ngx.var.remote_addr)        
}
```


The component uses [lua_shared_dict](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_shared_dict) to share cache between all workers.

If you want to increase the cache size you need to change this value `lua_shared_dict crowdsec_cache 50m;`.

:warning: Do not rename the `crowdsec_cache` shared dict, else the bouncer will not work anymore.

#### When using captcha remediation

To make HTTP request in the component, we need to set a `resolver` in the configuration. We choose `local=on` directive since we query `google.com` for the captcha verification, but you can replace it with a valid one.

To make secure HTTP request in the component, we need to specify a trusted certificate (`lua_ssl_trusted_certificate`). 
You can also change this with a valid one :
```
  - /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt (Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo)
  - /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt (Fedora/RHEL 6)
  - /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem (OpenSUSE)
  - /etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem (OpenELEC)
  - /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem (CentOS/RHEL 7)
  - /etc/ssl/cert.pem (OpenBSD, Alpine)
```


### Application Security Component Configuration

To setup the Application Security Component you first need to install it in your CrowdSec Security Engine.

On the Remediation Component side, you just need to configure the following option in the Remediation Component file:

```bash title="/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-openresty-bouncer.conf"
# Mandatory
APPSEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7422
# URL of the AppSec Component

# Optional
APPSEC_FAILURE_ACTION=passthrough  # default
APPSEC_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=100         # default
APPSEC_SEND_TIMEOUT=100            # default
APPSEC_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=1000        # default
ALWAYS_SEND_TO_APPSEC=false        # default
SSL_VERIFY=true                    # default
```


### Setup captcha
> Currently, we have support for 3 providers: recaptcha, hcaptcha or turnstile

If you want to use captcha with your OpenResty, you must provide a Site key and Secret key in your component configuration. If you wish to use any other provider than recaptcha you must also provide a Captcha provider.

([recaptcha documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro)).

([tunstile documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/)).

([hcaptcha documentation](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/))

Edit `etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-openresty-bouncer.conf` and configure the following options:

```bash
CAPTCHA_PROVDER=
SECRET_KEY=
SITE_KEY=
CAPTCHA_TEMPLATE_PATH=/var/lib/crowdsec/lua/templates/captcha.html
CAPTCHA_EXPIRATION=3600
```

Restart OpenResty.

You can add a decisions with a type `captcha` to check if it works correctly:

```bash
sudo cscli decisions add -i <IP_TO_TEST> -t captcha
```

## FAQ

### Why aren't decisions applied instantly

In stream mode, the component will launch an internal timer to pull the local API at the first request. So the cache won't be refreshed until the first request hits the service.

### Resolver and certificates

In order to resolve the captcha provider you need to set a resolver and a SSL certificate in your nginx configuration.
If you already have a resolver set in nginx configuration, you don't need to add another one.
Here is a config example, but you can change values:

```bash title="/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/conf.d/crowdsec_openresty.conf"
resolver local=on ipv6=off;
lua_ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt;
```

And restart OpenResty.


### Migrate from v0 to v1

The best way to migrate from the crowdsec-openresty-bouncer v0.* to v1 is to reinstall the bouncer. Indeed, many new configurations options are now available and some has been removed.

- Backup your CrowdSec Local API key from your configuration file (`/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-openresty-bouncer.conf`)
- Remove the old component:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge crowdsec-openresty-bouncer
```

- Install the new component:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crowdsec-openresty-bouncer
```

- Configure the component in `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-openresty-bouncer.conf`

## Configuration Reference

### `API_KEY`
