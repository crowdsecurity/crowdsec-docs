## Overview

The `crowdsec-awf-waf-bouncer` automatically adds rules to an AWS WAF ACL and manages IPSets content to apply decisions taken by crowdsec.

This allows to protect the following AWS resources with crowdsec:
 - AWS REST API Gateway
 - Cloudfront distribution
 - AWS Application LoadBalancer
 - AWS AppSync GraphQL API

As the component does not manage your WAF ACLs, you will need to have existing ACLs already associated with your AWS resources for the component to work properly.
The component supports the `ban` and `captcha` remediation type and can be configured to fall back to one of those for decisions of unknown type.

It can block at the IP (using `ip` scope in CrowdSec), range (using `range` scope in CrowdSec) or country level (using `country` scope in CrowdSec).

The component will create all required resources and associate them with your existing ACLs based on your provided configuration.

As the resources will incur an AWS cost, the component will remove everything it created when stopping.

If you do not have an existing AWS WAF configuration, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to get started.

## Installation

### Using packages

Packages for crowdsec-aws-waf-bouncer [are available on our repositories](/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec#install-our-repositories). You need to pick the package accord to your firewall system :

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' ,},
    { label: 'RHEL/Centos/Fedora', value: 'rhel', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-aws-waf-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
sudo yum install crowdsec-aws-waf-bouncer
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Docker

```shell
docker run -e BOUNCER_CONFIG_FILE=/cs-aws-waf-bouncer.yaml -v $(PWD)/config.yaml:/cs-aws-waf-bouncer.yaml crowdsecurity/aws-waf-bouncer
```

:::info

The remediation component can take some time to delete all created resources on shutdown.

The default docker timeout of 10s before sending a `SIGKILL` to the process might not always been enough.

You can increase it by specifying `--stop-timeout` in your `run` command or by setting `stop_grace_period` when using compose.

:::


## Configuration Reference

You will need to edit `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-aws-waf-bouncer.yaml` to configure the ACLs you want the component to use.

```yaml
api_key: XXXX
api_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
update_frequency: 10s
waf_config:
  - web_acl_name: mywebacl
    fallback_action: ban
    rule_group_name: crowdsec-rule-group-eu-west-1
    scope: REGIONAL
    region: eu-west-1
    ipset_prefix: crowdsec-ipset-a
    ip_header: X-Forwarded-For
    ip_header_position: LAST
	  aws_profile: myprofile
  - web_acl_name: test-cloudfront
    fallback_action: captcha
    rule_group_name: crowdsec-rule-group-cloudfront
    scope: CLOUDFRONT
    ipset_prefix: crowdsec-ipset-cf
```

Optionally, the component can also be configured using only environment variables.

Environment variables will take priority over values defined in the configuration file, in which case the suggested approach is via `systemctl edit crowdsec-aws-waf-bouncer`:

```
[Service]
Environment="BOUNCER_API_KEY=XXXXX"
```

AWS authentication is handled with the standard environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_PROFILE) or instance role.

You can also use the `aws_profile` directive to specify a profile to use for a specific waf configuration.

### `api_key`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_API_KEY`

API key to use for communication with LAPI.

### `api_url`

List of object with the following properties:

```
waf_config:
  - web_acl_name: mywebacl
    fallback_action: ban
    rule_group_name: crowdsec-rule-group-XXX
    scope: REGIONAL
    region: eu-west-1
    ipset_prefix: crowdsec-ipset-
```
:::info
When configuring via environment variables, you can pass multiple `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_` variables, with `X` being a unique identifier (eg, `0`, `1`, `2`).
:::

### `web_acl_name`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_WEB_ACL_NAME`


Name of the WAF ACL in which the rule group will be added

### `fallback_action`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_FALLBACK_ACTION`

Action to use if the type of a decision is not in the list defined by `supported_actions`.

Must be one of `captcha`, `ban` or `count`.

### `rule_group_name`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_RULE_GROUP_NAME`


Name of the rule group the component will create and add to the WAF ACL.

Must be unique across all the configuration.

2 rules can be created:
 - crowdsec-rule-ban
 - crowdsec-rule-captcha

Those rules are automatically deleted if no decisions of the associated type exist.

If a decision for a country is received, the following rules will be created:
 - crowdsec-rule-ban-country: Contains a geomatch statement for banned countries
 - crowdsec-rule-captcha-country: Contains a geomatch statement for captcha'ed countries

Those rules will be deleted on shutdown and recreated on startup if they already exist.

### `scope`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_SCOPE`


Scope of the rule group and ipset. Can be `REGIONAL` or `CLOUDFRONT`.

Must match the scope of the WAF ACL.

### `region`

No required when scope is `CLOUDFRONT`

### `ipset_prefix`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_IPSET_PREFIX`

Prefix for all the ipsets the component will create.

One ipset will be created per 10k IPs, and will be automatically deleted if it becomes empty.

Differents ipsets are used for ban and captcha.

:::warning
All ipsets are deleted on shutdown.
:::

### `aws_profile`
> string

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_AWS_PROFILE`

If not defined, the actual source IP will be used.

The request will be allowed if the header is not present or contains no valid IP.

### `ip_header_position`
> `FIRST`, `LAST`, `ANY`

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_IP_HEADER_POSITION`

If the header used to get the source IP is a comma-separated list, this parameter can be used to specify which part of the list should be used.

Required when `ip_header` is defined.

### `capacity`
> int

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_CAPACITY`

Capacity of the rule group created by the component.

If not set, default to 300 (this value is way higher than it needs to be, but this prevents any kind of issue regarding capacity of the rule group).

For reference, a simple match on a IP with no custom header will cost 1 WCU per IPSet created by the bouncer, or 5 WCU if you are getting the source IP from a header. 

See [AWS WAF documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/how-aws-waf-works.html#aws-waf-capacity-units) for more information.

### `sample_requests`
> boolean

> Environment variable: `BOUNCER_WAF_CONFIG_X_SAMPLE_REQUESTS`

Whether or not to sample requests from the rule groups created by the component.

## IAM Permissions

Because the component needs to interact with AWS resources, it need the proper permissions.

Here is the set of required permissions:
```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "wafv2:UpdateWebACL",
                "wafv2:UpdateRuleGroup",
                "wafv2:UpdateIPSet",
                "wafv2:TagResource",
                "wafv2:GetWebACL",
                "wafv2:GetRuleGroup",
                "wafv2:GetIPSet",
                "wafv2:DeleteRuleGroup",
                "wafv2:DeleteIPSet",
                "wafv2:CreateRuleGroup",
                "wafv2:CreateIPSet"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:wafv2:*:*:global/webacl/*/*",
                "arn:aws:wafv2:*:*:global/rulegroup/*/*",
                "arn:aws:wafv2:*:*:global/managedruleset/*/*",
                "arn:aws:wafv2:*:*:*/ipset/*/*"
            ],
            "Sid": "WAF1"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "wafv2:ListWebACLs",
                "wafv2:ListRuleGroups",
                "wafv2:ListIPSets"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "WAF2"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

AWS requires the resource for `wafv2:List*` to be `*`.

For the other permissions, we recommend to restrict the resources to only the WebACL the component is configured to interact with and the rule groups/ipsets the component will create.
