# Interractive Security Engine Installation Guide

Welcome! This interactive guide will help you set up your CrowdSec Security Engine and validate each step to ensure proper operation.
We'll guide you through detecting and remediating malicious behavior in your services' logs, regardless of your chosen implementation (on host, Docker, Kubernetes)

:::info
Note that to go further later you'll be able to enable Application Security and benefit from our ever growing collection of Virtual Patching rules.  We'll mention the appropriate dependencies as we go along.
Lastly, note that we'll cover a setup that focuses on an autonomous security engine parsing the logs of any services from local or remote servers. 
In appendix we'll cover the possibility to have distributed security engines on each servers, centralizing their alerts on a central security engine.
:::

## Install CrowdSec

The first step is to install the CrowdSec Security Engine somewhere you'll have access to the logs of services you want to protect.
You can choose to install it directly on the host, in a Docker container, or in a Kubernetes cluster.  

For a first experience, we recommend installing it on a host machine, as it will allow you to easily access the logs of your services and test the remediation capabilities.
But if you're comfortable with Docker it also is a great way to get started and run CrowdSec in a containerized environment.  

### Instructions

/* We'll have to see how precise and embeded we want the various guides to be with this page
    If we want full guides in here we'd better be able to embed files or pieces of files rather than copy paste

### Verification

// dump the content of the testmdximport mdx file here
// this is a test to see if the mdx import works properly
// if it does not work, we can remove this part and just have the testmdximport in the next section
<testmdximport />
