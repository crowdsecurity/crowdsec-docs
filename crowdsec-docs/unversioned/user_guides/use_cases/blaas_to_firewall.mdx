# Use Case: Integrating CrowdSec Blocklists Directly Into Your Firewall

> Use CrowdSec's Blocklist within your firewall without the need to install the CrowdSec agent.

## **Steps to follow**
For this use case, you will need to:
- [Create a **Blocklist As A Service endpoint** within the CrowdSec Console UI or API](/u/blocklists/blaas_integrations/intro)
   - **Who**: Anybody with a browser
   - **Skill Level**: Easy
   - **Time**: 5 minutes *(including account creation)*
   - **Minium Plan**: free
- [**Subscribe** to the blocklist(s) you want to use](u/console/blocklists/subscription)
   - **Who**: Anybody with a browser
   - **Skill Level**: Easy
   - **Time**: < 5 minutes
   - **Minium Plan**: free
- Make a **rule into your firewall** that fetches the blocklist from the BLAAS endpoint (basic auth URL)
   - **Who**: Firewall administrator
   - **Skill Level**: Easy
   - **Time**: 5~10 minutes

## Test that it works and evaluate performance
Depending on your firewall capabilities you can chose a metered action in your rule OR observe volume of ingress reaching your services before and after using the blocklist.   
Note that


# Next step: Scale and Automate
You can use CrowdSec Service API (SAPI) to automate both:
- [**creation of BLaaS endpoints**](/u/service_api/quickstart/integrations#creating-integration) 
- And [**blocklist subscriptions**](/u/service_api/quickstart/blocklists#subscribe-to-a-blocklist)

You can also look into [**creating**](/u/service_api/quickstart/blocklists#create-a-blocklist) and Sharing your own blocklists via SAPI.
