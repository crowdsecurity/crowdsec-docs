## Introduction

The `CrowdSec Bouncer` extension for Magento 2 has been designed to protect Magento 2 websites from all kinds of attacks by using [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) technology.

### Prerequisites

To be able to use this bouncer, the first step is to install [CrowdSec v1](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/getting_started/install_crowdsec/).
CrowdSec is only in charge of the "detection", and won't block anything on its own. You need to deploy a bouncer to "apply" decisions.

Please note that first and foremost CrowdSec must be installed on a server that is accessible via the Magento 2 site.


## Usage

### Features

When a user is suspected by CrowdSec to be malevolent, this bouncer will either send him/her a captcha to resolve or
simply a page notifying that access is denied. If the user is considered as a clean user, he will access the page as normal.

By default, the ban wall is displayed as below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/front-ban.jpg')} alt="Ban wall" title="Ban wall" />

By default, the captcha wall is displayed as below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/front-captcha.jpg')} alt="Captcha wall" title="Captcha wall" />

Please note that it is possible to customize all the colors of these pages in a few clicks so that they integrate best with your design.

On the other hand, all texts are also fully customizable. This will allow you, for example, to present translated pages in your users’ language.


### Configurations

This module comes with configurations that you will find under `Stores → Configurations → Security → CrowdSec Bouncer` admin section.

These configurations are divided in four main parts : `General Settings`, `Theme customizations`, `Advanced settings` and `Events`.


#### General Settings

In the `General settings` part, you will set your connection details and refine bouncing according to your needs.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-connection-details.jpg')} alt="Connection details" title="Connection details" />

***

`Connection details → Your Local API Url` (`global` scope)

Url to join your CrowdSec Local API.

If the CrowdSec Agent is installed on this server, you could set this field to `http://localhost:8080`.


***

`Connection details → Authentication type` (`global` scope)

Choose between API key and TLS (pki) authentication.

TLS authentication is only available if you use CrowdSec agent with a version superior to 1.4.0.
Please see [CrowdSec documentation](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/local_api/tls_auth/).


***

`Connection details → Your bouncer key` (`global` scope)

Key generated by the cscli command.

Only if you chose `Api key` as authentication type.

***

`Connection details → Path to the bouncer certificate` (`global` scope)

Relative path to the `var` folder of your Magento 2 instance.

Example: `crowdsec/tls/bouncer.pem`.

Only if you chose `TLS` as authentication type.

***

`Connection details → Path to the bouncer key` (`global` scope)

Relative path to the `var` folder of your Magento 2 instance.

Example: `crowdsec/tls/bouncer-key.pem`.

Only if you chose `TLS` as authentication type.

***

`Connection details → Enable TLS peer verification` (`global` scope)

This option determines whether request handler verifies the authenticity of the peer's certificate.

Only if you chose `TLS` as authentication type.

When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.
If `Enable TLS peer verification` is set to true, request handler verifies whether the certificate is authentic.
This trust is based on a chain of digital signatures,
rooted in certification authority (CA) certificate you supply using the `Path to the CA certificate for peer verification` setting below.

***

`Connection details → Path to the CA certificate for peer verification` (`global` scope)

Relative path to the `var` folder of your Magento 2 instance.

Example: `crowdsec/tls/ca-chain.pem`.

Only if you chose `TLS` as authentication type.

***

`Connection details → Use cURL` (`global` scope)

By default, `file_get_contents` method is used to call Local API. This method requires to have enabled the option
`allow_url_fopen`.
Here, you can choose to use `cURL` requests instead. Beware that in this case, you need to have php `cURL` extension installed and enabled on your system.


**N.B** : Even before saving configuration, you can check if your settings are correct by clicking on the test button.

 ***

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-bouncing.jpg')} alt="Bouncing" title="Bouncing" />


***

`Bouncing → Enable bouncer on Frontend area` (`store view` scope)

Choose which store views you want to protect.

***

`Bouncing → Enable bouncer on Adminhtml area` (`global` scope)

Choose if you want to protect admin too.

***

`Bouncing → Enable bouncer on API areas` (`global` scope)

Choose if you want to protect REST, SOAP and GraphQL endpoints.


**N.B** : For API calls, there will be no ban or captcha wall. User will receive a `401` (ban) or `403` (captcha) response code.

***

`Bouncing → Bouncing level` (`store view` scope)

Choose if you want to apply CrowdSec directives (Normal bouncing) or be more permissive (Flex bouncing).

With the `Flex mode`, it is impossible to accidentally block access to your site to people who don’t deserve it. This
mode makes it possible to never ban an IP but only to offer a Captcha, in the worst-case scenario.

***



#### Theme customizations

In the `Theme customizations` part, you can modify texts and colors of ban and captcha walls. All fields here are
store view scoped, so you can use different languages and designs.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-captcha-wall.jpg')} alt="Captcha wall customization" title="Captcha wall customization" />

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-ban-wall.jpg')} alt="Ban wall customization" title="Ban wall customization" />

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-css.jpg')} alt="Wall CSS" title="Wall CSS" />


####  Advanced settings


In the `Advanced settings` part, you can enable/disable the stream mode, choose your cache system for your CrowdSec
Local API, handle your remediation policy and adjust some debug and log parameters.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-communication-mode.jpg')} alt="Communication mode" title="Communication mode" />

***

`Communication mode to the API → Enable the stream mode` (`global` scope)

Choose if you want to enable the `stream mode` or stay in `live mode`.


By default, the `live mode` is enabled. The first time a stranger connects to your website, this mode means that the IP will be checked directly by the CrowdSec API. The rest of your user’s browsing will be even more transparent thanks to the fully customizable cache system.

But you can also activate the `stream mode`. This mode allows you to constantly feed the bouncer with the malicious IP list via a background task (CRON), making it to be even faster when checking the IP of your visitors. Besides, if your site has a lot of unique visitors at the same time, this will not influence the traffic to the API of your CrowdSec instance.

***

`Communication mode to the API → Cron expression for cache refresh` (`global` scope)

With the stream mode, every decision is retrieved in an asynchronous way. Here you can define the frequency of this
cache refresh.

**N.B** : There is also a refresh button if you want to refresh the cache manually.


***

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-cache.jpg')} alt="Cache" title="Cache" />

***

`Cache configuration → Technology` (`global` scope)

Choose the cache technology that will use your CrowdSec Local API.

The File system cache is faster than calling Local API. Redis or Memcached is faster than the File System cache.

**N.B** : There are also a clear cache button fo all cache technologies and a prune cache button dedicated to the
file system cache.

***

`Cache configuration → Cron expression for file system cache pruning` (`global` scope)

If you chose file system as cache technology, you can schedule here an automatic cache pruning cron task.

***


`Cache configuration → Redis DSN` (`global` scope)

Only if you choose Redis cache as technology. Example of DSN: redis://localhost:6379.

***


`Cache configuration → Memcached DSN` (`global` scope)

Only if you choose Memcached cache as technology. Example of DSN: memcached://localhost:11211.

***


`Cache configuration → Clean IPs cache duration` (`global` scope)

The duration between re-asking Local API about an already checked clean IP.

Minimum 1 second.  Note that this setting can not be apply in stream mode.

***

`Cache configuration → Bad IPs cache duration` (`global` scope)

The duration between re-asking Local API about an already checked bad IP.

Minimum 1 second.  Note that this setting can not be apply in stream mode.

***


`Cache configuration → Captcha flow cache duration` (`global` scope)

The lifetime of cached captcha flow for some IP. If a user has to interact with a captcha wall, we store in cache some values in order to know if he has to resolve or not the captcha again.

Minimum 1 second.

***

`Cache configuration → Geolocation cache duration` (`global` scope)

The lifetime of cached country result for some IP. Note that this setting can not be apply only if the
`Geolocation → Save geolocation country result in cache` below is enabled.

Minimum 1 second.

***

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-geolocation.jpg')} alt="Geolocation" title="Geolocation" />

***

`Geolocation → Enable geolocation feature` (`global` scope)

Enable if you want to handle CrowdSec country scoped decisions.

***

`Geolocation → Save geolocation country result in cache` (`global` scope)

Enabling this option will avoid multiple call to the geolocation system (e.g. MaxMind database).

***

`Geolocation → Geolocation type` (`global` scope)

At this time, only MaxMind type is allowed.

***

`Geolocation → MaxMind database type` (`global` scope)

Choose between `Country` and `City` depending on your MaxMind database.

***

`Geolocation → MaxMind database path` (`global` scope)

Relative path to the `var` folder of your Magento 2 instance.

***

**N.B** : There is also a test button if you want to test your geolocation settings.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-remediations.jpg')} alt="Remediations" title="Remediations" />


***

`Remediations → Fallback to` (`global` scope)

Choose which remediation to apply when CrowdSec advises unhandled remediation.

***


`Remediations → Trust these CDN Ips` (`global` scope)

If you use a CDN, a reverse proxy or a load balancer, it is possible to indicate in the bouncer settings the IP ranges of these devices in order to be able to check the IP of your users. For other IPs, the bouncer will not trust the X-Forwarded-For header.

***

`Remediations → Hide CrowdSec mentions` (`global` scope)

Enable if you want to hide CrowdSec mentions on the Ban and Captcha walls.
***

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-debug.jpg')} alt="Debug" title="Debug" />

***

`Configure the debug mode → Enable debug log` (`global` scope)

Enable if you want to see some debug information in a specific log file.

***

`Configure the debug mode → Display bouncings errors` (`global` scope)

When this mode is enabled, you will see every unexpected bouncing errors in the browser.

***

`Configure the debug mode → Disable prod log` (`global` scope)

The prod log is lighter than the debug log. But you can disable it here.

***

`Configure the debug mode → Forced test IP` (`global` scope)

For test purpose only. If not empty, this IP will be used for all remediations and geolocation processes.

***

`Configure the debug mode → Forced test forwarded IP` (`global` scope)

For test purpose only. This IP will be used instead of the current `X-Forwarded-For` IP if any.

***

#### Events


In the `Events` part, you can enable business events logging. Using it in combination to a specific CrowdSec
scenario allows detecting suspicious behavior as credential or credit card stuffing.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/bouncer/magento/screenshots/config-event.jpg')} alt="Events" title="Events" />

***

`Logging → Enable events log` (`global` scope)

If enabled, logs will be written in a `var/log/crowdsec-events.log` file.

***

`Logging → Track customer registration` (`global` scope)

Will be used to detect suspicious account creation.

***

`Logging → Track customer login` (`global` scope)

Will be used to detect credential stuffing.

***

`Logging → Track admin user login` (`global` scope)

Will be used to detect admin brute attacks.

***

`Logging → Track add to cart process` (`global` scope)

Will be used to detect suspicious behaviour with add to cart action.

***

`Logging → Track order process` (`global` scope)

Will be used to detect suspicious behaviour, as credit card stuffing, on order action.

### Auto Prepend File mode

By default, this extension will bounce every web requests: e.g requests called from webroot `index.php`.
This implies that if another php public script is called (`cron.php` if accessible for example, or any of your
custom public php script) bouncing will not be effective.
To ensure that any php script will be bounced if called from a browser, you should try the `auto prepend file` mode.

In this mode, every browser access to a php script will be bounced.

To enable the `auto prepend file` mode, you have to:

- copy the `crowdsec-prepend.php.example` file in your Magento 2 `app/etc` folder and rename it `crowdsec-prepend.php`
- configure your server by adding an `auto_prepend_file` directive for your php setup.

**N.B:**
- Beware that you have to copy the file before modifying your PHP configuration,or you will get a PHP fatal error.
- Note that if you upgrade the bouncer module, you should have to copy the file again. To make this copy
  automatically, you should modify the root `composer.json` of your Magento 2 projects by adding `post-install-cmd`
  and `post-update-cmd` to the scripts parts:

```
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "php -r \"copy('vendor/crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer/crowdsec-prepend.php.example','app/etc/crowdsec-prepend.php');\""
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "php -r \"copy('vendor/crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer/crowdsec-prepend.php.example','app/etc/crowdsec-prepend.php');\""
    ]
}
```


Adding an `auto_prepend_file` directive can be done in different ways:

#### PHP

You should add this line to a `.ini` file :

    auto_prepend_file = /magento2-root-directory/app/etc/crowdsec-prepend.php


#### Nginx


If you are using Nginx, you should modify your Magento 2 nginx configuration file by adding a `fastcgi_param`
directive. The php block should look like below:

```
location ~ \.php$ {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE "/magento2-root-directory/app/etc/crowdsec-prepend.php";
}
```

#### Apache

If you are using Apache, you should add this line to your `.htaccess` file:

    php_value auto_prepend_file "/magento2-root-directory/app/etc/crowdsec-prepend.php"




## Installation

### Requirements

- Magento >= 2.3

### Composer installation

Use `Composer` by simply adding `crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer` as a dependency:

    composer require crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer 

### Post Installation

#### Enable the module

After the installment of the module source code, the module has to be enabled by the Magento 2 CLI.

    bin/magento module:enable CrowdSec_Bouncer

#### System Upgrade

After enabling the module, the Magento 2 system must be upgraded.

If the system mode is set to production, run the compile command first. This is not necessary for the developer mode.


    bin/magento setup:di:compile

Then run the upgrade command:


    bin/magento setup:upgrade


#### Clear Cache

The Magento 2 cache should be cleared by running the flush command.

    bin/magento cache:flush

#### Deploy static content

At last, you have to deploy the static content:

    bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f


### Troubleshooting

#### Higher matching error

If a new version `y.y.y` has been published in Packagist and the Marketplace review process of this version is still in progress,
you could encounter the following error during installation on update:

> Higher matching version y.y.y of crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer was found in public repository packagist.org
> than x.x.x in private https://repo.magento.com. Public package might've been taken over by a malicious entity,
> please investigate and update package requirement to match the version from the private repository

This error is due to the `magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin` composer plugin introduced in Magento `2.4.3` as a security measure [against Dependency Confusion attacks](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410675867917-Composer-plugin-against-Dependency-Confusion-attacks).

##### Install the latest Marketplace release

To avoid this error and install the latest known Marketplace release `x.x.x`, you could run:

```bash
composer require crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer --no-plugins
```

##### Install the latest Packagist release

To avoid this error and install the latest known Packagist release `y.y.y`, you could modify the root `composer.json` of your Magento project by setting the `repo.magento.com` repository as non-canonical:

```
"repositories": {
    "0": {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://repo.magento.com/",
        "canonical": false
    }
},
```
And then run the same command:
```bash
composer require crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer --no-plugins
```

As an alternative, you can also exclude the `crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer` from the `repo.magento.com` repository:
```
"repositories": {
    "0": {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://repo.magento.com/",
        "exclude": ["crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer"]
    }
},
```

Thus, running `composer require crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer` will always pick up the latest `y.y.y` Packagist release.
