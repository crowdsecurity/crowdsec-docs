A lua bouncer for haproxy.

## How does it work ?

This bouncer leverages haproxy lua's API to check e IP address against the local API.

Supported features:

 - Stream mode (pull the local API for new/old decisions every X seconds)
 - Ban remediation (can ban an IP address by redirecting him or returning a custom HTML page)
 - reCAPTCHA v2 remediation (can return a captcha)
 - Works with IPv4/IPv6
 - Support IP ranges (can apply a remediation on an IP range)


## Installation

### Using packages

First, [setup crowdsec repositories](/getting_started/install.mdx#install-our-repositories).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="haproxy_debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'haproxy_debian' ,},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="haproxy_debian">

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


:::info
In stream mode, the bouncer will launch an internal timer to pull the local API at the first request made to the server.
:::

### Manual installation

:::warning
It has been tested only on Debian/Ubuntu based distributions.
:::

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-haproxy-bouncer/releases)

```bash
tar xvzf crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer.tgz
cd crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer-v*/
./install.sh
```
If you are on a mono-machine setup, the `crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer` install script will register directly to the local crowdsec, so you're good to go !


## Upgrade

### From package

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer
```

### Manual Upgrade

If you already have `crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer` installed, please download the [latest release](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-haproxy-bouncer/releases) and run the following commands:

```bash
tar xzvf crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer.tgz
cd crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer-v*/
sudo ./upgrade.sh
sudo systemctl restart haproxy
```

## Configuration

### Bouncer configuration

```bash title="/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer.conf"
API_KEY=<CROWDSEC_LAPI_KEY>
MAP_PATH= # path to community_blocklist.map
# bounce for all type of remediation that the bouncer can receive from the local API
BOUNCING_ON_TYPE=all
# when the bouncer receive an unknown remediation, fallback to this remediation
FALLBACK_REMEDIATION=ban
MODE=stream
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=1000
# exclude the bouncing on those location
EXCLUDE_LOCATION=
# Update frequency in stream mode, in second
UPDATE_FREQUENCY=10
#those apply for "ban" action
# /!\ REDIRECT_LOCATION and BAN_TEMPLATE_PATH/RET_CODE can't be used together. REDIRECT_LOCATION take priority over RET_CODE AND BAN_TEMPLATE_PATH
BAN_TEMPLATE_PATH=/var/lib/crowdsec/lua/templates/ban.html
REDIRECT_LOCATION=
RET_CODE=
#those apply for "captcha" action
# reCAPTCHA Secret Key
SECRET_KEY=
# reCAPTCHA Site key
SITE_KEY=
CAPTCHA_TEMPLATE_PATH=/var/lib/crowdsec/lua/templates/captcha.html
CAPTCHA_EXPIRATION=3600
```

### HAProxy Configuration

HAProxy must be amended with following configuration :

```bash title="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"
global
 ...
 # Crowdsec bouncer >>>
 lua-load /usr/lib/crowdsec/lua/crowdsec.lua # path to crowdsec.lua
 setenv CROWDSEC_CONFIG /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer.conf # path to crowdsec bouncer configuration file
 # Crowdsec bouncer <<<
 ...
frontend myApp
 ...
 # Crowdsec bouncer >>>
 stick-table type ip size 10k expire 30m # declare a stick table to cache captcha verifications
 http-request lua.crowdsec_allow # action to identify crowdsec remediation
 http-request track-sc0 src if { var(req.remediation) -m str "captcha-allow" } # cache captcha allow decision 
 http-request redirect location %[var(req.redirect_uri)] if { var(req.remediation) -m str "captcha-allow" } # redirect to initial url
 http-request use-service lua.reply_captcha if { var(req.remediation) -m str "captcha" } # serve captcha template if remediation is captcha
 http-request use-service lua.reply_ban if { var(req.remediation) -m str "ban" } # serve ban template if remediation is ban
 # Crowdsec bouncer <<<
 ...
# Crowdsec bouncer >>>
# define a backend for google to allow DNS resolution if using reCAPTCHA
backend captcha_verifier
 server captcha_verifier www.google.com:443 check

# define a backend for crowdsec to allow DNS resolution
backend crowdsec
 server crowdsec crowdsec:8080 check
# Crowdsec bouncer <<<
```

#### Crowdsec backend

You must declare a backend for Crowdsec so we're able to resolve it's address during the refresh task. the backend and the server both must be named `crowdsec`.

The decisions are stored in a [Map file](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/introduction-to-haproxy-maps/), the location of the map file is configured with `MAP_PATH` parameter.

#### When using captcha remediation

Using reCAPTCHA v2, You must declare a backend for Google so we're able to resolve it's address during captcha verification.

Validated ips are cached in a [Stick table](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/introduction-to-haproxy-stick-tables/) to avoid too many requests to reCAPTCHA verification endpoint.

### Setup captcha
> Currently, only reCAPTCHA v2 is supported.

If you want to use reCAPTCHA with your HAProxy Bouncer, you must provide a reCAPTCHA Site key and Secret key in your bouncer configuration ([recaptcha documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro)).

Edit `etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-haproxy-bouncer.conf` and configure the following options:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=
SITE_KEY=
CAPTCHA_TEMPLATE_PATH=/var/lib/crowdsec/lua/templates/captcha.html
CAPTCHA_EXPIRATION=3600
```

Restart HAProxy.

You can add a decisions with a type `captcha` to check if it works correctly:

```bash
sudo cscli decisions add -i <IP_TO_TEST> -t captcha
```

## FAQ

### Why aren't decisions applied instantly

In stream mode, the bouncer will launch an internal timer to pull the local API at the first request. So the cache won't be refreshed until the first request hits the service.

### SSL and certificates

In order to query `google.com` for the reCAPTCHA verification, you need SSL certificates. Make sure you have root certificates installed on your system. You can also install `ca-certificates`.

## References

### `API_KEY`
```bash
API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```

CrowdSec Local API key.

Generated with [`sudo cscli bouncers add`](../cscli/cscli_bouncers_add) command.

### `BOUNCING_ON_TYPE`
```bash
BOUNCING_ON_TYPE=all|ban|captcha
```

Type of remediation we want to bounce. 
If you choose `ban` only and receive a decision with `captcha` as remediation, the bouncer will skip the decision.

### `FALLBACK_REMEDIATION`
```bash
FALLBACK_REMEDIATION=ban
```

The fallback remediation is applied if the bouncer receives a decision with an unknown remediation.

### `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`
```bash
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=1000
```

Timeout in milliseconds for the HTTP requests done by the bouncer to query CrowdSec local API or www.google.com (for the reCAPTCHA verification).

### `EXCLUDE_LOCATION`
```bash
EXCLUDE_LOCATION=/<path1>,/<path2>
```

The locations to exclude while bouncing. It is a list of location, separated by commas.

:warning: It is not recommended to put `EXCLUDE_LOCATION=/`.


### `UPDATE_FREQUENCY`
> This option is only for the `stream` mode.

```bash
UPDATE_FREQUENCY=10
```

### `REDIRECT_LOCATION`
> This option is only for the `ban` remediation.

```bash
REDIRECT_LOCATION=/<path>
```

The location to redirect the user when there is a ban.

If it is not set, the bouncer will return the page defined in the `BAN_TEMPLATE_PATH` with the `RET_CODE` (403 by default).

### `BAN_TEMPLATE_PATH`
> This option is only for the `ban` remediation.

```bash
BAN_TEMPLATE_PATH=<path_to_html_template>
```

The path to a HTML page to return to IPs that trigger `ban` remediation.

By default, the HTML template is located in `/var/lib/crowdsec/lua/templates/ban.html`.


### `RET_CODE`
> This option is only for the `ban` remediation.

```bash
RET_CODE=403
```

The HTTP code to return for IPs that trigger a `ban` remediation.
If nothing specified, it will return a 403.

```

The reCAPTCHA v2 secret key.


### `SITE_KEY`
> This option is only for the `captcha` remediation.

```bash
SITE_KEY=<recaptcha_site_key>

CAPTCHA_TEMPLATE_PATH=<path_to_html_template>
```

The path to a captcha HTML template.

The bouncer will try to replace `{{recaptcha_site_key}}` in the template with `SITE_KEY` parameter.

By default, the HTML template is located in `/var/lib/crowdsec/lua/templates/captcha.html`.


### `CAPTCHA_EXPIRATION`
> This option is only for the `captcha` remediation.

```bash
CAPTCHA_EXPIRATION=3600
```


The time for which the captcha will be validated. After this duration, if the decision is still present in CrowdSec local API, the IPs address will get a captcha again.
