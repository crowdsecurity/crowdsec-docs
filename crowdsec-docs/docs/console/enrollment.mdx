:::info
$ID will be used as the placeholder for your enrollment ID, you can find this within the [console](https://app.crowdsec.net/).
:::

## Standalone

You can enroll a [Security Engine](/getting_started/getting_started.md) into the console to get a full overview of your alerts. This process is handled by the following `cscli` command:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nix"
  groupId="console-operating-systems"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux/Freebsd', value: 'nix'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="nix">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">sudo cscli console enroll $ID</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">cscli.exe console enroll $ID</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Docker / Podman

:::info
Docker commands are interchangeable with podman.
:::

If you are using docker, you can enroll the Security Engine by passing the enrollment ID as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -e ENROLL_KEY=$ID crowdsecurity/crowdsec
```

If you already have a deployment running this can also be enrolled by using the `cscli` command:

```bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> cscli console enroll $ID
```

If you are using automatic deployments, then you can automate the enrollment process depending on the system:

## K8s / Helm

K8's and helm use our standard container image so can also use the enrollment ID as an environment variable:

```yaml
lapi:
  env:
    - name: ENROLL_KEY
      value: $ID
```

:::info
Note here we are placing it within the LAPI environment **NOT** the agent as the agent is not responsible for the enrollment process.
:::

## Chef, Puppet, Ansible

If you are using a configuration management tool, you can use the `cscli` command to enroll the Security Engine:

```bash
sudo cscli console enroll $ID
```
