:::info
$ID will be used as the placeholder for your enrollment ID, you can find this within the [console](https://app.crowdsec.net/).
:::

## Standalone

You can enroll a [Security Engine](/getting_started/getting_started.md) into the console to get a full overview of your alerts. This process is handled by the following `cscli` command:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nix"
  groupId="console-operating-systems"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux/Freebsd', value: 'nix'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="nix">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">sudo cscli console enroll $ID</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">cscli.exe console enroll $ID</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Docker / Podman

:::info
Docker commands are interchangeable with podman.
:::

If you are using docker, you can enroll the Security Engine by passing the enrollment ID as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -e ENROLL_KEY=$ID crowdsecurity/crowdsec
```

If you already have a deployment running this can also be enrolled by using the `cscli` command:

```bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> cscli console enroll $ID
```

If you are using automatic deployments, then you can automate the enrollment process depending on the system:

## K8s / Helm

K8's and helm use our standard container image so can also use the enrollment ID as an environment variable:

```yaml
lapi:
  env:
    - name: ENROLL_KEY
      value: $ID
```

:::info
Note here we are placing it within the LAPI environment **NOT** the agent as the agent is not responsible for the enrollment process.
:::

## Chef, Puppet, Ansible

If you are using a configuration management tool, you can use the `cscli` command to enroll the Security Engine:

```bash
sudo cscli console enroll $ID
```

# Troubleshooting

## Where can I find my enrollment key?

You can find your enrollment key within the [console](https://app.crowdsec.net/).

Once you have authenticated, you can find the key within the `Add Security Engine` button on the [Security Engines page](https://app.crowdsec.net/security-engines).

## My security engine is failing to connect to the console?

The Security Engine and `cscli` must have internet access, this can be through a proxy or directly. If you are using a proxy, you can configure it using the GOLANG `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables

## My security engine has already been enrolled on another account, can I transfer it?

Yes, you can transfer the security engine within the console interface to another organization.

If for whatever reason you cannot access the old account you can force the new enrollment by running the `cscli` command with the force flag:

```bash
sudo cscli console enroll $ID --force
```
