The [console](https://app.crowdsec.net) is a web interface hosted by crowdsec that allows you to get even more from crowdsec :
 - aggregate, tag and classify your instances (without having them share a common local API)
 - view/filter/export alerts in real-time
 - get statistics and insights on your alerts compared
 - organization management, MFA and more
 - and much more
