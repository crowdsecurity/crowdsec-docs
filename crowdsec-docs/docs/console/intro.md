- **Alert Statistics and Insights**: Gain access to comprehensive statistics and insights regarding your alerts. This feature allows you to analyze and understand your security landscape, helping you make informed decisions.

- **Organization Management**: The Console provides tools for efficiently managing your organization's security operations. You can organize users, configure multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more to ensure robust security practices.

- **And much more**: Beyond the mentioned features, the CrowdSec Console offers a host of additional functionalities to empower your security operations and enhance your overall experience.
