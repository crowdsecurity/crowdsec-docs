For those that prefer hands-on approach, you can as well [manually install crowdsec](/user_guides/building.md).

## Install our repositories

Installing our repositories allows you to access the latest packages of the Security Engine and Remediation Components.

:::info
We are using [packagecloud.io service](https://packagecloud.io/crowdsec/crowdsec/).
While `curl | sudo shell` can be convenient for some, [alternative installation methods are available](https://packagecloud.io/crowdsec/crowdsec/install#manual).
:::

```bash
curl -s https://install.crowdsec.net | sudo sh
```


## Install the Security Engine

Before installing the package, you might want to check [the ports that will be used](/docs/next/configuration/network_management).

You now have the Security Engine running ! You can move forward and install a [remediation component](/u/bouncers/intro), or take a [tour](/getting_started/crowdsec_tour.mdx) of the software beforehand !

Directories:

* The application lives in the folder `/etc/crowdsec`.
* The data is stored in the folder `/var/lib/crowdsec/data`.


## Remediation Component

:::caution

Keep in mind that a CrowdSec package is only in charge of the "detection", and won't block anything on its own.
You need to deploy a [Remediation Component](/u/bouncers/intro) to enforce decisions.

:::

## Enrolling your instance

The next step is to enroll your instance with the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/security-engines?enroll-engine=true).

For the benefits, please visit the [Console section](/console/intro.md).

## Running CrowdSec on Raspberry Pi OS/Raspbian 

Please keep in mind that Raspberry Pi OS is designed to work on all
Raspberry Pi versions. Even if the port target is known as armhf, it's
not exactly the same target as the debian named armhf port.

The best way to have a CrowdSec version for such an architecture is to
do:

1. install golang (all versions from 1.20 will do)
2. `export GOARCH=arm`
3. `export CGO=1`
4. Update the GOARCH variable in the Makefile to `arm`
5. install the arm gcc cross compiler (On debian the package is gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf)
6. Compile CrowdSec using the usual `make` command
