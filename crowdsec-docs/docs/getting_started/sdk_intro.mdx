CrowdSec offers lightweight SDKs for Python and PHP to help developers seamlessly integrate signal sharing capabilities into their security tools, platforms, or services.

By using these SDKs, you can report signals such as suspicious IP activity or confirmed attacks directly to the Central API (CAPI). In return, your users gain access to the CrowdSec Community Blocklist, a curated and constantly updated list of IPs involved in malicious behavior observed across the global CrowdSec network.

Why Integrate the SDK:
- **Simple Integration** — Add signal sharing with just a few lines of code
- **Community-Powered Protection** — Contributions help power our global threat intelligence network
- **Mutual Benefit** — Your platform shares valuable intelligence and gains stronger real-time protection in return

## Supported SDKs

* [Python SDK](install_pyagent)
* [PHP SDK](install_php_softagent)

Whether you're building a WAF, SIEM, or a custom security tool, the CrowdSec SDKs make it easy to contribute to and benefit from a collaborative defense network.
