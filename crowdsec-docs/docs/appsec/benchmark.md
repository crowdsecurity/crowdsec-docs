# Basic Benchmark

The Application Security Component benchmarks have been run on a AWS EC2 Instance `t2.medium` (2vCPU/4GiB RAM).

All the benchmarks have been run with only one `routine` configured for the Application Security Component.

The benchmarks cover the following tests:

- Basic GET request:
  - 5 concurrent connections / 1000 requests
  - 15 concurrent connections / 1000 requests

<!--- POST request (50Ko body):
  - 5 concurrent connections / 1000 requests
  - 15 concurrent connections / 1000 requests
-->

Each test has been run with multiple cases:

- Application Security Component enabled but without any rules
- Application Security Component enabled with 100 vpatch rules (in in-band)
- Application Security Component enabled with all the CRS (in in-band)

On the system, we deployed:

- Openresty `1.21.4.3`
- CrowdSec `v1.6.0`
- cs-openresty-bouncer `v1.0.1`

## Basic GET request

### 5 concurrent connections / 1000 requests

# Stress Test

This test was run on a `c5a.4xlarge` EC2 instance (16CPU/32GiB RAM).

Tested versions are:

- Openresty `v1.27.1.2`
- CrowdSec `v1.7.0`
- cs-openresty-bouncer `v1.1.2`

Openresty was configured to not log anything and forward requests to a Go backend that always return 200, in order to improve raw throughput and not be limited by disk access.

Crowdsec WAF was configured with 16 routines to make use of as much CPU as possible.

All tests were simulating 400 concurrent users, making requests as quickly as possible during 1 minute.

Except for the baseline, all values in the tables are shown as a delta from the baseline performance.

## Baseline

This test was run without loading the Openresty bouncer to get a baseline throughput of the system.
