# WAF Rules Deployment

This walkthrough assumes you already wrote and validated a custom AppSec (WAF) rule. We will deploy a concrete example so you can mirror the exact commands on your host.

## Example Rule We Will Deploy

The example blocks any `GET` request whose `user_id` query argument contains non-numeric characters. While you iterate locally, keep it in a working directory as `./block-nonnumeric-user-id.yaml`:

```yaml title="./block-nonnumeric-user-id.yaml"
name: custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id
description: Block GET requests with a non-numeric user_id parameter.
rules:
  - and:
      - zones:
          - METHOD
        match:
          type: equals
          value: GET
      - zones:
          - ARGS
        variables:
          - user_id
        match:
          type: regex
          value: "[^0-9]"
labels:
  type: exploit
  service: http
  confidence: 2
  spoofable: 0
  behavior: "http:exploit"
  label: "Non numeric user id"
```

Once the rule behaves as expected, the remaining steps package it for CrowdSec, wire it into the acquisition pipeline, and test it end to end.

## Step 1 — Stage the Rule File

CrowdSec loads AppSec rules from `/etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/`. Copy your YAML rule into that directory (create a `custom/` subfolder to keep things tidy if you manage several rules):

```bash
sudo install -d -m 750 /etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/custom
sudo install -m 640 ./block-nonnumeric-user-id.yaml \
  /etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id.yaml
```

Make sure the `name` inside the rule file matches the file name convention you plan to reference (in our example `custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id`).

:::tip
If you run CrowdSec in a container, copy the file into the volume that is mounted at `/etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/` inside the container.

## Step 2 — Create an AppSec Configuration

An AppSec configuration lists which rules to load and how to handle matches. Create a new file under `/etc/crowdsec/appsec-configs/` that targets your custom rule:

```yaml title="/etc/crowdsec/appsec-configs/custom-block-nonnumeric-user-id.yaml"
name: custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id
default_remediation: ban
inband_rules:
  - custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id
# Add outofband_rules or hooks here if needed
```

Key points:
- `name` is how you will reference this configuration from the acquisition file and in logs.
- `inband_rules` (and/or `outofband_rules`) accept glob patterns, so you can load multiple rules with a single entry such as `custom/block-*`.
- During the reload step CrowdSec validates the syntax; if anything is off, the reload fails and the service logs the parsing error.

## Step 3 — Reference the Configuration in the Acquisition File

The AppSec acquisition file (`/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml`) controls which configurations are active for the WAF component. Add your configuration to the `appsec_configs` list. Order matters: later entries override conflicting defaults such as `default_remediation`.

```yaml title="/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml"
appsec_configs:
  - crowdsecurity/appsec-default
  - custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id
labels:
  type: appsec
listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:7422
source: appsec
```

If you only want to run your custom configuration, remove other entries and keep the list with a single item.

## Step 4 — Reload CrowdSec and Validate the Load

Apply the changes by reloading the CrowdSec service:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload crowdsec
```

If your init system does not support reload, perform a restart instead. Then verify the rule and configuration are active:

```bash
sudo cscli appsec-rules list | grep block-nonnumeric-user-id
sudo cscli appsec-configs list | grep block-nonnumeric-user-id
```

The rule should appear as `enabled`, and the configuration should show up in the list. CrowdSec logs confirm the configuration was loaded without errors.

## Step 5 — Functional Test with `curl`

Trigger the behaviour your rule is meant to catch to ensure it blocks as expected. For the example rule, send a request with a non-numeric `user_id` value:

```bash
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1/profile?user_id=abc123'
```

A successful block returns an HTTP status such as `403 Forbidden`, and CrowdSec logs a matching alert:

```bash
sudo cscli alerts list -s custom/block-nonnumeric-user-id
```

If the request is not blocked, double-check that the rule `name` matches the pattern in your AppSec configuration, that the acquisition file lists your configuration, and that the CrowdSec service picked up the changes.

## Next Steps

- Add automated regression tests with `cscli hubtest` so future updates do not break the rule.
- Version-control your custom rule and configuration files to keep track of changes.
