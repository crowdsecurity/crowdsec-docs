# CrowdSec WAF QuickStart for Traefik

## Objectives

The goal of this quickstart is to set up the [AppSec
Component](/appsec/intro.md#introduction) to safeguard web applications running
on [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) reverse proxy. We'll deploy a [set
of
rules](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching)
designed to block [well-known
attacks](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-generic-rules)
and [currently exploited
vulnerabilities](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching).
Additionally, we'll show how to monitor these alerts through the
[console](https://app.crowdsec.net/).

## Pre-requisites

1. If you're new to the [AppSec Component](/appsec/intro.md#introduction) or
**W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewalls, start with the
[Introduction](/appsec/intro.md#introduction) for a better understanding.

2. It's assumed that you have already installed:
   - **CrowdSec [Security Engine](intro.mdx)**: for installation, refer to the [QuickStart guide](/u/getting_started/installation/linux). The AppSec Component, which analyzes HTTP requests, is included within the security engine as a <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Acquisition files tell CrowdSec where to find logs and which application they belong to.">Acquisition</UnderlineTooltip>.
   -  Traefik Plugin **[Remediation Component](/u/bouncers/intro)**: Thanks to [maxlerebourg](https://github.com/maxlerebourg) and team they created a [Traefik Plugin](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin) that allows you to block requests directly from Traefik.

:::info
Prior to starting the guide ensure you are using the [Traefik
Plugin](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin)
and **NOT** the older and deprecated
[traefik-crowdsec-bouncer](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/fbonalair/remediation-components/traefik-crowdsec-bouncer)
as it hasnt received updates to use the new AppSec Component.
:::

:::warning
This guide will assume you already have a working Traefik setup using the
Traefik Plugin. If you need help setting up Traefik, refer to the [official
documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) and the [Traefik
Plugin](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin)
documentation.
:::

## AppSec Component Setup

### Collection installation

To begin setting up the AppSec Component, the initial step is to install a
relevant set of rules.

We will utilize the
[crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching)
collection, which offers a wide range of rules aimed at identifying and
preventing the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

This <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Collections are bundle of parsers, scenarios,
postoverflows that form a coherent package.">collection</UnderlineTooltip> is
regularly updated to include protection against newly discovered
vulnerabilities. Upon installation, it receives automatic daily updates to
ensure your protection is always current.

Furthermore we also install the
[crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-generic-rules)
collection. This collection contains detection scenarios for generic attack
vectors. It provides some protection in cases where specific scenarios for
vulnerabilities do not exist (yet).


:::info
You can always view the content of a [collection on the hub](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching)
:::

<Tabs
  groupId="crowdsec-appsec-collection"
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    { label: 'Docker', value: 'docker' },
    { label: 'Docker Compose', value: 'dockerCompose' },
    { label: 'Kubernetes (Helm)', value: 'kubernetes' },
  ]}
>

  <TabItem value="docker">

```bash
## This command should be used when you are persisting /etc/crowdsec/ on the host
docker exec -it crowdsec cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules
```

This command installs the needed appsec hub configuration items.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dockerCompose">

```yaml title="values.yaml"
services:
  crowdsec:
    environment:
      - 'COLLECTIONS=crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules'
```

:::warning
Please note the spaces between the collection names (hence why the quotes are needed).
:::

This compose configuration file will add some needed hub configuration items.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubernetes">

Please add this in your `values.yaml` for your CrowdSec release.

```yaml title="values.yaml"
appsec:
  env:
    - name: COLLECTIONS
      value: "[...] crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules [...]"
```


:::warning
Please note the spaces between the collection names (hence why the double quotes are needed).
:::

Now you can apply it with:
```
helm upgrade crowdsec crowdsec/crowdsec -n crowdsec --create-namespace -f ./crowdsec-values.yaml
```

This `values.yaml` modification will add some needed hub configuration items.


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Those needed hub configuration items are:

- The [*AppSec Rules*](/appsec/rules_syntax.md) contain the definition of
  malevolent requests to be matched and stopped.
- The [*AppSec
  Configuration*](/appsec/configuration.md#appsec-configuration-files) links
  together a set of rules to provide a coherent set.
- The <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="YAML files that extract relevant data from
  logs, such as IP addresses, timestamps, or request paths.">CrowdSec
  Parser</UnderlineTooltip> and <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Behavioral rules
  written in a domain-specific language that define what malicious activity
  looks like, such as multiple failed logins in a short time.">CrowdSec
  Scenario(s)</UnderlineTooltip> are used to detect and remediate persistent
  attacks.

Once you have updated your compose or installed via the command line, will we
need to restart the container. However, before we do that, we need to setup the
acquisition for the AppSec Component.

### Setup the Acquisition

You now need to setup the acquisition for AppSec. The way it's done highly
depends on how you run CrowdSec.

<Tabs
  groupId="crowdsec-appsec-acquisition"
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    { label: 'Docker', value: 'docker' },
    { label: 'Docker Compose', value: 'dockerCompose' },
    { label: 'Kubernetes (Helm)', value: 'kubernetes' },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="docker">

In the directory where you persist configuration files, create an `appsec.yaml` file and mount it into the container.

**Steps**

1. Change to the directory where you ran the `docker run` or `docker compose` command.  
2. Create a file named `appsec.yaml` in this directory.  
3. Add the following content:

```yaml title="appsec.yaml"
appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-desfault
labels:
  type: appsec
listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:7422
source: appsec
```

Because CrowdSec runs inside a container, set listen_addr to 0.0.0.0 instead of
127.0.0.1 so it can accept connections from outside the container.

Edit your docker run command to mount the file:

If a crowdsec container is already running, stop/remove it before re-running with the updated mounts.

```bash
docker run -d --name crowdsec \
  -v /path/to/original:/etc/crowdsec \
  -v ./appsec.yaml:/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml \
  crowdsecurity/crowdsec
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="dockerCompose">

In the directory where you persist configuration files, create an appsec.yaml file and mount it into the container.

**Steps**

1. Change to the directory where you ran the docker compose (or docker run) command.
2. Create a file named appsec.yaml in this directory.
3. Add the following content to the `appsec.yaml`

appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
labels:
  type: appsec
listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:7422
source: appsec

Because CrowdSec runs in a container, set listen_addr to 0.0.0.0 (not 127.0.0.1) so it listens on the containerâ€™s network interface.

Mount the file in your Compose service:
``` 
services:
  crowdsec:
    volumes:
      - /path/to/original:/etc/crowdsec   # or a named volume
      - ./appsec.yaml:/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml
```

Once you have updated the compose file to include the volume mount and the updated environment variable, you can restart the container.

```bash
docker compose down crowdsec
docker compose rm crowdsec
docker compose up -d crowdsec
```

:::note
The previous compose commands presume the container is named `crowdsec`. If you have named the container something else, you will need to replace `crowdsec` with the name of your container.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubernetes">
With kubernetes the acquisition setup is twofolds:
We have to add 
```yaml title="values.yaml"
appsec:
  acquisitions:
    - appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
      labels:
        type: appsec
      listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:7422
      path: /
      source: appsec
  enabled: true
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs> 


## Remediation Component Setup

As stated previously this guide already presumes you have the Traefik Plugin installed. If you do not have the Traefik Plugin installed, please refer to the [official documentation](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin) for installation instructions.

### Configuration

Depending on how you configured the Traefik Plugin, you will need to update the configuration to include the AppSec configuration.

:::warning
Currently AppSec does not support mTLS authentication for the AppSec Component. If you have mTLS enabled, and wish to use the AppSec Component, you can define seperate middlewares for the AppSec Component.
:::

<Tabs
  groupId="traefik-remediation"
  defaultValue="dynamic"
  values={[
    { label: 'Traefik dynamic configuration', value: 'dynamic' },
    { label: 'Traefik middleware (Kubernetes)', value: 'kubernetes' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="dynamic">
If you have defined a dynamic configuration file for Traefik, you can add the following configuration to the file.

```yaml title="traefik_dynamic.yaml"
# Dynamic configuration
http:
  routers:
    my-router:
      rule: host(`whoami.localhost`)
      service: service-foo
      entryPoints:
        - web
      middlewares:
        - crowdsec

  services:
    service-foo:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://127.0.0.1:5000
  
  middlewares:
    crowdsec:
      plugin:
        bouncer:
          enabled: true
          crowdsecAppsecEnabled: true
          crowdsecAppsecHost: crowdsec:7422
          crowdsecAppsecFailureBlock: true
          crowdsecAppsecUnreachableBlock: true
          crowdsecLapiKey: privateKey-foo
```


Instead if you define the configuration using labels on the containers you can add the following labels to the Traefik Plugin container.

```yaml
  labels:
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec-bar.plugin.bouncer.enabled=true"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec-bar.plugin.bouncer.crowdsecAppsecEnabled=true"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec-bar.plugin.bouncer.crowdsecAppsecHost=crowdsec:7422"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec-bar.plugin.bouncer.crowdsecLapiKey=privateKey-foo"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubernetes">
Here's a Traefik Middleware ressource you can apply with
```bash
kubectl apply -f traefik-middleware.yaml
```

```yaml values="traefik-middleware.yaml"
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: crowdsec
  namespace: traefik
spec:
  plugin:
    crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin:
      enabled: true
      crowdsecMode: stream
      crowdsecLapiScheme: http
      crowdsecLapiHost: crowdsec-service.crowdsec.svc.cluster.local:8080
      crowdsecLapiKey: <shadowed>
      htttTimeoutSeconds: 60
      forwardedheaderstrustedips:
        - 10.0.0.0/8
        - 192.168.0.0/16
        - 134.209.137.94
        - 2a03:b0c0:2:f0::f557:a001
      crowdsecAppsecEnabled: false
      crowdsecAppsecHost: crowdsec:7422
      crowdsecAppsecFailureBlock: true
      crowdsecAppsecUnreachableBlock: true
```

You can still add some route configuration through
[IngressRoute](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/routing-configuration/kubernetes/crd/http/ingressroute/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
and attach the middleware to those routes.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For more comprehensive documentation on the Traefik Plugin configuration, please
refer to the [official
documentation](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin).

We can't cover all the possible configurations for Traefik in this guide, so please refer to the [official documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) for more information.

### Directives

The following directives are available for the Traefik Plugin:

#### `crowdsecAppsecEnabled`
> `bool`

Enable or disable the AppSec Component.

#### `crowdsecAppsecHost`
> `string`

The host and port where the AppSec Component is running.

#### `crowdsecAppsecFailureBlock`
> `bool`

If the AppSec Component returns `500` status code should the request be blocked.

#### `crowdsecAppsecUnreachableBlock`
> `bool`

If the AppSec Component is unreachable should the request be blocked.

## Testing the AppSec Component + Remediation Component

:::note
We're assuming the web server is installed on the same machine and is listening on port 80. Please adjust your testing accordingly if this is not the case.
:::

if you try to access `http://localhost/.env` from a browser, your request will be blocked, resulting in the display of the following HTML page:

![appsec-denied](/img/appsec_denied.png)

We can also look at the metrics from `cscli metrics show appsec` it will display:
 - the number of requests processed by the AppSec Component
 - Individual rule matches

### Explanation

What happened in the test that we just did is:

 1. We did a request (`localhost/.env`) to our local webserver
 2. Thanks to the Remediation Component configuration, forwarded the request to `http://127.0.0.1:7422`
 3. Our AppSec Component, listening on `http://127.0.0.1:7422` analyzed the request
 4. The request matches the [AppSec rule to detect .env access](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/appsec-rules/vpatch-env-access)
 5. The AppSec Component thus answered with [HTTP 403](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403) to the Remediation Component, indicating that the request must be blocked
 6. The web server then presented us with the default "request blocked" page.

 ## Integration with the console

If you haven't yet, follow the guide about [how to enroll your Security Engine in the console](/u/getting_started/post_installation/console).

Once done, all your alerts, including the ones generated by the AppSec Component, are going to appear in the console:

![appsec-console](/img/appsec_console.png)

## Next steps

You are now running the AppSec Component on your Crowdsec Security Engine, congrats!

As the next steps, you can:
 - [Explore the hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) to find more rules for your use case
 - Look at the [Rules syntax](/appsec/rules_syntax.md) and [creation process](/appsec/create_rules.md) to create your own and contribute
 - Take a look at [the benchmarks](/appsec/benchmark.md)
