# CrowdSec WAF QuickStart for WordPress

## Objectives

The goal of this quickstart is to set up the [AppSec Component](/appsec/intro.md#introduction) to safeguard web applications running on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) sites.

We'll deploy a [set of rules](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching) designed to block [well-known attacks](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-generic-rules) and [currently exploited vulnerabilities](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching).

Additionally, we'll show how to monitor these alerts through the [console](https://app.crowdsec.net/).

## Pre-requisites

1. If you're new to the [AppSec Component](/appsec/intro.md#introduction) or **W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewalls, start with the [Introduction](/appsec/intro.md#introduction) for a better understanding.

2. It's assumed that you have already installed:
   - **CrowdSec [Security Engine](intro.mdx)**: for installation, refer to the [QuickStart guide](/u/getting_started/installation/linux). The AppSec Component, which analyzes HTTP requests, is included within the security engine as a [Acquisition](/log_processor/data_sources/appsec.md).
   - **WordPress [Remediation Component](/u/bouncers/intro)**: installation instructions are available in the [WordPress bouncer guide](/u/bouncers/wordpress). The CrowdSec WordPress plugin enables you to protect your WordPress site against malicious traffic using CrowdSec's advanced threat detection and blocklist capabilities.

    This component intercepts HTTP requests at the WordPress level and forwards them to the AppSec Component for analysis and action.


## AppSec Component Setup

### Collection installation

To begin setting up the AppSec Component, the initial step is to install a relevant set of rules.

We will utilize the [`crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching`](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching) collection, which offers a wide range of rules aimed at identifying and preventing the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

This <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Collections are bundle of parsers, scenarios, postoverflows that form a coherent package.">collection</UnderlineTooltip> is regularly updated to include protection against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Upon installation, it receives automatic daily updates to ensure your protection is always current.
Furthermore we also install the [`crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules`](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-generic-rules) collection. This collection contains detection scenarios for generic attack vectors. It provides some protection in cases where specific scenarios for vulnerabilities do not exist (yet).

On the machine where the Security Engine is installed, just execute the following command:

:::info
You can always view the content of a [collection on the hub](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/appsec-virtual-patching)
:::

```bash
sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/appsec-virtual-patching crowdsecurity/appsec-generic-rules
```

Executing this command will install the following items:

- The [*AppSec Rules*](/appsec/rules_syntax.md) contain the definition of malevolent requests to be matched and stopped
- The [*AppSec Configuration*](/appsec/configuration.md#appsec-configuration) links together a set of rules to provide a coherent set
- The <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="YAML files that extract relevant data from logs, such as IP addresses, timestamps, or request paths.">CrowdSec Parser</UnderlineTooltip> and <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Behavioral rules written in a domain-specific language that define what malicious activity looks like, such as multiple failed logins in a short time.">CrowdSec Scenario(s)</UnderlineTooltip> bans for a longer duration repeating offenders

### Setup the Acquisition

Having installed the required components, it's time to configure the CrowdSec <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Acquisition files tell CrowdSec where to find logs and which application they belong to.">Acquisition</UnderlineTooltip> to expose the Application Security Component to our WordPress site. This configuration allows our WordPress site to send requests to the AppSec Component for evaluation and decision-making.

Steps:
    1. Create the `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/` directory (if it doesn't exist on your machine)
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/
    ```
    2. Create a file `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml` with the following content:
    ```yaml title="/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml"
    appsec_config: crowdsecurity/appsec-default
    labels:
      type: appsec
    listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:7422
    source: appsec
    ```

The two important directives in this configuration file are:

 - `appsec_config` is the name of the [*AppSec Configuration*](appsec/configuration.md#appsec-configuration) that was included in the <UnderlineTooltip tooltip="Collections are bundle of parsers, scenarios, postoverflows that form a coherent package.">Collection</UnderlineTooltip> we just installed.
 - the `listen_addr` is the IP and port the AppSec Component will listen to.

:::warning
We do not recommend exposing the AppSec Component to the internet. It should only be accessible from the web server or WordPress application.
::: 

:::info
You can find more about the [supported options for the acquisition here](/log_processor/data_sources/appsec.md)
:::

You can now restart CrowdSec:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
```

#### Testing the AppSec Component

##### Verify the AppSec Component is listening

To verify that the AppSec Component is running correctly, we can first check that the port `7422` is open and listening:

:::note
If you have changed the port in the configuration file, replace `7422` with the new port number.
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="netstat"
  groupId="listening-ports"
  values={[
    {label: 'Netstat', value: 'netstat'},
    {label: 'SS', value: 'ss'},
  ]}>
  
  <TabItem value="netstat">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">sudo netstat -tlpn | grep 7422</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ss">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">sudo ss -tlpn | grep 7422</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>

<summary>Output example</summary>

```bash
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:7422            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      12345/crowdsec
```

:::note
The output may look differently depending on which command you used but as long as you see the port and the process `crowdsec`, it means the AppSec Component is running.
:::

##### (Optional) Manually testing the AppSec Component with `curl`

<details>
  <summary>Expand for short guide</summary>

Before we proceed with configuring the Remediation Component, let's verify that all our current setups are functioning correctly.

1. Create a Remediation Component (Bouncer) API Key:

```bash
sudo cscli bouncers add test_waf -k this_is_a_bad_password
API key for 'test_waf':

   this_is_a_bad_password

Please keep this key since you will not be able to retrieve it!
```

2. Emit a legitimate request to the AppSec Component:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7422/ -i -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-uri: /test' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-ip: 192.168.1.1' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-host: foobar.com' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-verb: POST' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-api-key: this_is_a_bad_password'
```

Which will give us an answer such as:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:43:50 GMT
Content-Length: 36
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

{"action":"allow","http_status":200}
```

3. Emit a malevolent request to the Appsec Component:

:::info
We're trying to access a `.env` file, a [common way to get access to some credentials forgotten by a developer.](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/appsec-rules/vpatch-env-access)
:::

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:7422/ -i -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-uri: /.env' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-ip: 192.168.1.1' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-host: foobar.com' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-verb: POST' -H 'x-crowdsec-appsec-api-key: this_is_a_bad_password'

```

Our request is detected and blocked by the AppSec Component:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:57:08 GMT
Content-Length: 34
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

{"action":"ban","http_status":403}
```

Let's now delete our test API Key:

```bash
sudo cscli bouncers delete test_waf
```

</details>

## Remediation Component Setup

Since our AppSec Component is active and listening, we can now configure the WordPress Remediation Component to forward requests to it.

The WordPress bouncer includes built-in AppSec support that can be enabled through the plugin's admin interface.

### Enable AppSec in WordPress Plugin

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
2. Navigate to the CrowdSec plugin settings (`CrowdSec` in your admin menu)
3. Go to the `Advanced` section
4. Find the `AppSec component` configuration section
5. Enable AppSec and configure the connection:

   - **Enable AppSec**: Check this box to enable AppSec functionality
   - **URL**: Set to `http://127.0.0.1:7422` (or your custom AppSec Component address)
   - **Request timeout**: Default is 400 milliseconds (adjust as needed)
   - **Fallback to**: Choose `captcha` (recommended) for when AppSec calls fail
   - **Maximum body size**: Default is 1024 KB
   - **Body size exceeded action**: Choose `headers_only` (recommended)


![appsec-config](/img/bouncer/wordpress/screenshots/config-appsec.png)

:::info
AppSec functionality is only available when using API key authentication (not TLS certificates) in the WordPress plugin.
:::

:::note
The AppSec Component will only be consulted when the initial LAPI remediation returns a bypass decision.
:::

## Testing the AppSec Component + Remediation Component

:::note
We're assuming WordPress is running on your local machine. Please adjust your testing accordingly if this is not the case.
:::

To test the AppSec functionality, you need to make a request that will go through the WordPress loading process. Try accessing a WordPress page with a malicious payload in the URL parameters or body.
For example, we can try to post a request with a body that contains a malicious payload, known as a [Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-22965)](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/appsec-rules/vpatch-CVE-2022-22965) attempt.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-wordpress-uri>/ -d "class.module.classLoader.resources." -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}"
```


When the AppSec Component detects such a malicious request, you'll see that the response is a 403 (Forbidden) status code, indicating that the request was blocked.

If your test is not successful, please refer to the [Health check and troubleshoot guide](/u/getting_started/health_check/) for help.


You can also look at the metrics from `cscli metrics show appsec` which will display:
 - the number of requests processed by the AppSec Component
 - Individual rule matches

 <details>
  <summary>Example Output</summary>


```bash title="sudo cscli metrics show appsec"

├─────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┤
│ crowdsecurity/vpatch-CVE-2022-22965 │ 1         │
╰─────────────────────────────────────┴───────────╯
```

</details>

### Explanation

What happened in the test that we just did is:

 1. We made a request with malicious payload to our WordPress site
 2. The WordPress bouncer plugin intercepted the request as part of the WordPress loading process
 3. The bouncer first checked with the local CrowdSec API for any existing decisions
 4. Since there was no existing ban decision, the bouncer forwarded the request to the AppSec Component at `http://127.0.0.1:7422`
 5. Our AppSec Component analyzed the request and matched it against the appropriate AppSec rules (here `crowdsecurity/vpatch-CVE-2022-22965` rule)
 6. The AppSec Component returned an HTTP 403 response to the WordPress bouncer, indicating that the request must be blocked
 7. The WordPress bouncer then presented the visitor with the configured ban page

 ## Integration with the console

If you haven't yet, follow the guide about [how to enroll your Security Engine in the console](/u/getting_started/post_installation/console).

Once done, all your alerts, including the ones generated by the AppSec Component, are going to appear in the console:

![appsec-console](/img/appsec_console.png)

## WordPress-Specific Considerations

### Understanding Plugin Limitations

The WordPress bouncer has some inherent limitations you should be aware of:

1. **WordPress Loading Process**: The plugin only protects requests that go through the WordPress core loading process. Direct access to PHP files outside of WordPress won't be protected.

2. **Static Files**: Requests for non-PHP files (like `.env`, `.sql`, or other static files) won't be processed by the plugin since they don't go through PHP.

3. **Auto Prepend File Mode**: For comprehensive protection, consider enabling [auto prepend file mode](/u/bouncers/wordpress#auto-prepend-file-mode) in the plugin settings to ensure all PHP scripts are protected.


## Next steps

You are now running the AppSec Component on your WordPress site with CrowdSec Security Engine, congrats!

As the next steps, you can:
 - [Explore the hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) to find more rules for your use case
 - Look at the [Rules syntax](/appsec/rules_syntax.md) and [creation process](/appsec/create_rules.md) to create your own and contribute
