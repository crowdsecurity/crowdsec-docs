# Security Engine Overview

The [CrowdSec Security Engine](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) is an open-source, lightweight security engine that detects and blocks malicious actors. It analyzes logs and HTTP requests using behavior-based patterns called scenarios.

CrowdSec is modular: it provides [behavior-based detection](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/collections), including [AppSec rules](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/appsec-rules), and optional [Remediation Components](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/bouncers) that enforce blocks.

CrowdSec is crowdsourced: when you participate, you share the attacks you detect and block. In return, the Security Engine automatically downloads a curated list of validated attackers (the community blocklist), so you can take action sooner against known threats.

## Main Features

In addition to the core "detect and react" mechanism, CrowdSec is committed to several other key aspects:

-   **Easy Installation**: Get started quickly on all [supported platforms](/u/getting_started/intro).
-   **Simplified Daily Operations**: Manage and maintain your setup from the [CrowdSec Console](http://app.crowdsec.net) (Web UI) or with the [cscli command-line tool](/cscli/cscli.md).
-   **Reproducibility**: Analyze live logs and [cold logs](/u/user_guides/replay_mode) to validate detections, run forensic analysis, or generate reports.
-   **Versatile**: Protect your perimeter by analyzing [system logs](/log_processor/data_sources/introduction.md) and [HTTP requests](/appsec/intro.md).
-   **Observability**: Providing valuable insights into the system's activity:
    -   View and manage alerts in the [Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup).
    -   Expose detailed [Prometheus metrics](/observability/prometheus.md).
    -   Use the [cscli CLI](/observability/cscli.md) for administration.
-   **API-Centric**: All components communicate via an [HTTP API](/local_api/intro.md), facilitating multi-machine setups.

## Architecture

    </div>

Under the hood, the Security Engine has various components:

-   The [Log Processor](/log_processor/intro.mdx) handles detection. It analyzes logs from [various data sources](/log_processor/data_sources/introduction.md) and [HTTP requests](/appsec/intro.md) from compatible web servers.
-   The [Appsec](appsec/intro) feature is part of the Log Processor. It filters HTTP requests from compatible web servers.
-   The [Local API](local_api/intro.md) acts as a middleman:
    -   Between the [Log Processors](/log_processor/intro.mdx) and the [Remediation Components](/u/bouncers/intro) which are in charge of enforcing decisions.
    -   And with the [Central API](/central_api/intro.md) to share alerts and receive blocklists.
-   The [Remediation Components](/u/bouncers/intro) (also called bouncers) block malicious IPs at your chosen level—IpTables, firewalls, web servers, or reverse proxies. [See the full list on the CrowdSec Hub.](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/remediation-components)

## Deployment options

This architecture supports simple standalone setups and more distributed deployments:

-   Single machine: Follow the [getting started guide](/u/getting_started/intro).
-   Multiple machines: Use the [distributed setup guide](/u/user_guides/multiserver_setup).
-   Centralized logs (rsyslog, Loki, ...): [Run CrowdSec next to your log pipeline](/u/user_guides/log_centralization), not on production workloads.
-   Kubernetes: See [our Helm chart](/u/getting_started/installation/kubernetes).
-   Containers: Use the [Docker data source](/log_processor/data_sources/docker.md).
-   WAF only: Start with the [AppSec quickstart](appsec/intro).

Distributed architecture example:
