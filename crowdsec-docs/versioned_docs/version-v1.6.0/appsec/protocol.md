:::warning

This section is only relevant if you want to add support for the CrowdSec application security component in your own remediation component or directly at the application level.

:::

## Introduction

To interact with the CrowdSec application security component, a protocol need to be respected.

The application security component expect some headers to be present in the HTTP request (in addition to the original HTTP headers and body) and according to the result, the application security component will respond differently.

This documentation can be useful in case you want to write your own remediation component that interact with the CrowdSec application security component, or if you want to improve your existing one.

## HTTP Headers

To work with the CrowdSec application security component, some HTTP headers are require, in addition to the other HTTP headers and the body of the original request.

| Header Name                 | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Crowdsec-Appsec-Ip`      | The Real IP address of the original HTTP request                           |
| `X-Crowdsec-Appsec-Uri`     | The URI of the original HTTP request                                       |
| `X-Crowdsec-Appsec-Host`    | The Host of the original HTTP request                                      |
| `X-Crowdsec-Appsec-Verb`    | The Method of the original HTTP request                                    |
| `X-Crowdsec-Appsec-Api-Key` | The API Key to communicate with the CrowdSec application security component |

:::note

All requests forwarded by the remediation component must be sent via a `GET` request. However, if the HTTP request contains a body, a `POST` request must be sent to the Application Security Component.

:::

### Example

For this example:

- A `POST` HTTP request has been made by the IP `1.2.3.4` to a website on `example.com`.
- The Application Security Component listen on `http://localhost:4241/`.

## Response Code

According to the result of the processing of the HTTP request, the application security component will respond with a different HTTP code and body.

| HTTP Code | Description                                                                                                                                          | Body                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `200`     | The HTTP request is allowed                                                                                                                          | `{"action" : "allow"}`                           |
| `403`     | The HTTP request triggered one or more application security component rules                                                                           | `{"action" : "ban", "http_status": 403}` or `{"action" : "captcha", "http_status": 403}` |
| `500`     | An error occurred in the application security component. The remediation component must support a `APPSEC_FAILURE_ACTION` parameter to handle this case | `null`                                           |
| `401`     | The remediation component is not authenticated. It must use the same API Key that was generated to pull the local API request                        | `null`                                           |

In case of a `403` response, the body will contain the action to take and the HTTP status code to return to the client.
