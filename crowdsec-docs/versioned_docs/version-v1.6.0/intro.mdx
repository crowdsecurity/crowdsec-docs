# Security Engine Overview

The [CrowdSec Security Engine](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) is an open-source, lightweight software that detects and blocks malicious actors from accessing your systems at various levels, using log and HTTP Requests analysis with threat patterns called scenarios.

CrowdSec is a modular security tool offering [behavior-based detection](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/collections), including [AppSec rules](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/appsec-rules), and optional components to block threats called [Remediation Components](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/bouncers)

The crowd-sourced aspect allows the sharing of attacks they detected and blocked. Participants of this crowd-sourced threat intel receive, automatically via the security engine, a curated list of validated attackers (community blocklist) enhancing their real-time protection capabilities by taking preemptive actions against known threats.

## Main Features

In addition to the core "detect and react" mechanism, CrowdSec is committed to several other key aspects:

-   **Easy Installation**: Effortless out-of-the-box installation on all [supported platforms](/getting_started/versions_matrix.md).
-   **Simplified Daily Operations**: You have access to our Web UI administration via [CrowdSec's console](http://app.crowdsec.net) or the powerful [Command line tool cscli](/cscli/cscli.md) for effortless maintenance and keeping your detection mechanisms up-to-date.
-   **Reproducibility**: The Security Engine can analyze not only live logs but also [cold logs](/u/user_guides/replay_mode), making it easier to detect potential false triggers, conduct forensic analysis, or generate reports.
-   **Versatile**: The Security Engine can analyze [system logs](/docs/data_sources/intro) and [HTTP Requests](/docs/next/appsec/intro) to exhaustively protect your perimeter.
-   **Observability**: Providing valuable insights into the system's activity:
    -   Users can view/manage alerts from the ([Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup)).
    -   Operations personnel have access to detailed Prometheus metrics ([Prometheus](/observability/prometheus.md)).
    -   Administrators can utilize a user-friendly command-line interface tool ([cscli](/observability/cscli.md)).
-   **API-Centric**: All components communicate via an [HTTP API](/local_api/intro.md), facilitating multi-machine setups.

## Architecture

Under the hood, the Security Engine has various components:

-   The Log Processor is in charge of detection: it analyzes logs from [various data sources](/docs/data_sources/intro) or [HTTP requests](/appsec/intro.md) from web servers.
-   The [Appsec](/appsec/intro.md) feature is part of the Log Processor and filters HTTP Requests from the compatible web servers.
-   The [Local API](/local_api/intro.md) acts as a middle man:
    -   Between the [Log Processors](/docs/data_sources/intro) and the [Remediation Components](/u/bouncers/intro) which are in charge of enforcing decisions.
    -   And with the [Central API](/central_api/intro.md) to share alerts and receive blocklists.
-   The [Remediation Components](/u/bouncers/intro) - also known as bouncers - block malicious IPs at your chosen level—whether via IpTables, firewalls, web servers, or reverse proxies. [See the full list on our CrowdSec Hub.](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/remediation-components)

## Deployment options

This architecture allows for both simple/standalone setups, or more distributed ones including as illustrated below:

-   One or more machines? Run crowdsec on each (alongside with a remediation component)
-   Already have a log pit (such as rsyslog or loki)? Run crowdsec next to it, not on the production workloads
-   Running Kubernetes? Have a look at [our helm chart](/u/getting_started/installation/kubernetes)
-   Running containers? The [docker data source](/docs/data_sources/docker) might be what you need
-   Just looking for a WAF? Look at [our quickstart](/appsec/intro.md)

Distributed architecture example:
