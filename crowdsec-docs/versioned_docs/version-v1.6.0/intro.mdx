The [CrowdSec Security Engine](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) is an open-source, lightweight software that detects and blocks malicious actors from accessing your systems at various levels, using log analysis and threat patterns called scenarios. 

CrowdSec is a modular framework, offering a variety of [popular scenarios](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/collections). Users can choose their protection scenarios and deploy [Remediation Components](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/bouncers) to block malicious access.

The crowd-sourced aspect allows sharing attack information among users, enhancing real-time attack detection and preemptive blocking of known bad actors from your system.

## Main Features

In addition to the core "detect and react" mechanism, CrowdSec is committed to several other key aspects:

- **Easy Installation**: Effortless out-of-the-box installation on all [supported platforms](/getting_started/versions_matrix.md).
- **Simplified Daily Operations**: Use [cscli](/cscli/cscli.md) and the [hub](http://hub.crowdsec.net) for effortless maintenance and keeping your detection mechanisms up-to-date.
- **Reproducibility**: The Security Engine can analyze not only live logs but also [cold logs](/u/user_guides/replay_mode), making it easier to detect potential false triggers, conduct forensic analysis, or generate reports.
- **Observability**: Providing valuable insights into the system's activity:
    - Users can view/manage alerts from the ([Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup)).
    - Operations personnel have access to detailed Prometheus metrics ([Prometheus](/observability/prometheus.md)).
    - Administrators can utilize a user-friendly command-line interface tool ([cscli](/observability/cscli.md)).
- **API-Centric**: All components communicate via an [HTTP API](/local_api/intro.md), facilitating multi-machine setups.
