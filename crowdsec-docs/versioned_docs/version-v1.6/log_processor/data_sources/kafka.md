This module allows the `Security Engine` to acquire logs from a kafka topic.

## Configuration example

To monitor a kafka topic:
```yaml
source: kafka
topic: my-topic
brokers:
  - "localhost:9092"
timeout: 5
labels:
 type: mytype
```

To monitor a kafka topic using SSL:

```yaml
source: kafka
brokers:
  - "localhost:9093"
topic: "my-topic"
timeout: 5
tls:
  insecure_skip_verify: true
  client_cert: /path/kafkaClient.certificate.pem
  client_key: /path/kafkaClient.key
  ca_cert: /path/ca.crt
labels:
  type: nginx
```

Adding a batch configuration:

```yaml
source: kafka
brokers:
  - "localhost:9093"
topic: "my-topic"
timeout: 5
tls:
  insecure_skip_verify: true
  client_cert: /path/kafkaClient.certificate.pem
  client_key: /path/kafkaClient.key
  ca_cert: /path/ca.crt
labels:
  type: nginx
batch:
  min_bytes: 1024      # 1KB
  max_bytes: 1048576   # 1MB
  max_wait: 5s
  queue_size: 1000
  commit_interval: 1s
```

## Parameters


### `brokers`

The name of the kafka brockers to connect to.

Required.

### `topic`

The topic name you want to read logs from.

Required.

### `group_id`

The consumer group id to use.

Cannot be used with `partition`.

:::warning
It is highly recommended to set this value, or crowdsec will only read logs from the 1st partition of the topic.
:::

### `partition`

Read messages from the given partition. Mostly useful for debugging.

Cannot be used with `group_id`.

### `timeout`

Maximum time to wait for new messages before returning an empty read.

Default: 5

### `tls.insecure_skip_verify`

To disable security checks on the certificate.

Defaults to `false`

### `tls.client_cert`

The client certificate path.

Optional, when you want to enable TLS with client certificate.

### `tls.client_key`

The client key path.

Optional, when you want to enable TLS with client certificate.

### `tls.ca_cert`

The CA certificate path.

Optional, when you want to enable TLS with client certificate.

### `batch.min_bytes`

Minimum number of bytes to accumulate in the fetch buffer before returning results.

Default: 1

### `batch.max_bytes`

Maximum number of bytes to fetch in one go.

Default: 1048576 (1MB)

### `batch.max_wait`

Maximum time to wait before returning a fetch, even if `batch.min_bytes` isnâ€™t reached.

Default: 250ms

### `batch.queue_size`

Maximum number of messages to buffer internally before processing.

Default: 100

### `batch.commit_interval`

Time interval between automatic commits of consumer offsets.

Default: 0 (commit after every fetch)

### `source`

Must be `kafka`
