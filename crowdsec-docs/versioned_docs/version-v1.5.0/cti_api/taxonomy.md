## Scoring



 - `scores`: Indicators of malevolence associated with an IP address, computed over several periods of time : 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and overall. For a given period, the indicator of malevolence is summarized under the `total` key with a value ranging from **0** (no reports) to **5** (high malevolence). This value is a summary based on 4 components (see below) also ranging from **0** (Not Applicable/ Missing) to **5** (High), comparing to all the the signals reported by the community.

| indicator | explaination |
|-----------|--------------|
|Aggressiveness | _What is the intensity of the attack?_ This component measures the number of attacks reported over a period of time. |
|Threat Level | _How serious is the type of threats reported?_ The category of attacks reported by the community defines the danger induced by the attacks. An IP known for crawling and scanning will have a lower threat level than an IP reported for brute-force and exploits. This score ranges from 1 (mainly crawling) to 5 (exploit). 0 is the default for unknown scenarios |
|Trust| _What is the level of confidence in the actors which reported the IP address?_ This component is based on the reputation (age, number of reports) and the diversity (number of IP ranges, AS Numbers) of all the actors reporting the IP. It ranges from **0** (low\_confidence) to **5** (high confidence). |
| Anomaly |  _What are the red flags associated with this IP address?_ It analyses the static description of the reported IP address and checks for red flags which can be linked to evidence of malicious activities |
| Total | Aggregation of 4 component calculated on threats reported by the community and described below. |


 - `ip_range_score`: Score of malevolence associated with an IP range, ranging from *0* (No IP reported) to *5* (massively reported). It is calculated based on the number of IPs belonging to this range that were reported by the community as malicious

 - `behaviors`: One or more attack categories and behaviors associated with the IP. The category names and the associated labels should be self-explanatory. For example, `sip:bruteforce` would refer to an IP performing brute force attacks on the SIP protocol, while `http:exploit` would refer to an IP attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities on HTTP services. [An exhaustive list](#list-of-common-behaviors) is availabe bellow.

 - `expiration`: Only present for the "fire" route: Date at which the IP address expire from the community blocklist.
 - `ip_range_score`: the malevolence score of the IP range the IP belongs to. 0 is unknown, 1 is a couple of IP reported, 5 is the highest level for the most aggressive range. See "scoring" above
