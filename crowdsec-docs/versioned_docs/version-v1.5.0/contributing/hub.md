Parsers, Scenarios, Collections allow the `Security Engine` to detect and block malevolent behavior.

Supporting new services or improving the detection capabilities on existing software is a great way to contribute.

Sharing your parsers, scenarios and collections on the hub allows other users to use them to protect themselves.

# Contributing

Anyone can open an issue about parsers/scenarios, or contribute a change with a pull request (PR) to the crowdsecuity/hub GitHub repository. You need to be comfortable with git and GitHub to work effectively.

To get involved :

- Have a look at open [issues](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/pulls)
- Clone the hub repository
- Create/Modify parsers/scenarios/collections
- Create/Modify tests to ensure proper coverage
- Open a pull request

## Guidelines

### Technical Documentation

The following explains how to create and test:

- [parsers](/docs/parsers/create/)
- [scenarios](/docs/scenarios/create/)

### Collections

It often makes sense for a new parser or scenario to be added to an existing [collection](/docs/collections/format), or create a new one.

If your parsers and/or scenarios cover a new or specific service, having a dedicated collection for this service makes sense.
In other cases, having a parser for `SpecificWebServer` access logs would justify a collection as it might also include [all the default http related scenarios](https://hub.crowdsec.net/author/crowdsecurity/collections/base-http-scenarios).

## Preparing your contribution

Before asking for a review of your PR, please ensure you have the following:

- tests: Test creation is covered in [parsers creation](/docs/parsers/create/) and [scenarios creation](/docs/scenarios/create/). Ensure that each of your parser or scenario is properly tested.
- documentation: Please provide a `.md` file with the same name as each of your parser, scenario or collection. The markdown is rendered in the [hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net).
- documentation: If you're creating a collection targeting a specific log file, be sure to provide an acquis example as :


```yaml

    ## Acquisition template

    Example acquisition for this collection :

    ```yaml
    filenames:
    - /var/log/xxx/*.log
    labels:
    type: something
    ```
```

## Open your PR

Everything is all set, you can now open a PR, that will be reviewed and merged!
