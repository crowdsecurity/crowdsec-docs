## Getting Started

You want to contribute to Crowdsec? Fantastic!

In order to achieve this, this guide will provide you with all the needed information and guidance :+1:

### Communication

The main comunication channels of the project are:

- [discord](https://discord.gg/crowdsec): [Discord](https://discord.com/) is the most common communication medium of the project, and is especially suitable for live interactions (chatting).
- [discourse](https://discourse.crowdsec.net/): [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is a forum and is very useful to expose ideas and suggestions, or simply to formulate a question to which you didn't find answer on discord.
- [github](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/): Issues and Pull Requests are used to expose bugs and suggestions in a more formal way.

Do not hesitate to join & ask your questions!

## Making your first contribution

### Find something to work on

The first step to getting starting is to find something to work on. Help is always welcome, and no contribution is too small!

Here are some things you can do today to start contributing:

- Help improve the documentation
- Clarify code, variables, or functions that can be renamed or commented on
- Write test coverage
- Help triage issues

### Find a good first topic

There are multiple repositories within the Crowdsecurity organization. [Each repository](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/) has beginner-friendly issues that are a great place to get started on your contributor journey. For example, [crowdsecurity/crowdsec](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/issues) and [crowdsecurity/hub](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/hub/issues) have `help wanted` and `good first issue` labels for issues that donâ€™t need high-level Crowdsec knowledge to contribute to. The `good first issue` label also indicates that Crowdsecurity Members are committed to providing extra assistance for new contributors. Another way to get started is to find a documentation improvement, such as a missing/broken link, which will give you exposure to the code submission/review process without the added complication of technical depth.

## Contribution rules

The main components of the project have their dedicated contribution pages :

- [hub](/docs/contributing/contributing_hub)
- [crowdsec](/docs/contributing/contributing_crowdsec)
